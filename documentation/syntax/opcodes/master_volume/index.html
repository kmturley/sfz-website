Soundfonts are a completely different file format which includes both the samples and the definitions of sample behavior in the same binary file, while SFZ is a file format which only defines the behavior of musical instruments and does not include the sample content.

If the samples are the strings of a piano or pipes of an organ,\nthe SFZ file is the mechanism that connects the key to the hammer which strikes\nthe strings or the air and signals to the pipes of the organ.\n\nSFZ files can be opened, edited, and created in any text editor application,\neven the default 'Notepad' in Windows. No external software is necessary\nto create or modify a SFZ file, though there are some pieces of software\nor scripts out there which greatly ease the creation or editing process.\nAn example of this is an automapper, which is a script or application that takes\na sample set and uses the names of the samples or actual audio content\nto determine how to map those samples.\n\nThe SFZ file's role is a simple, two-part operation:\n1. Explain how to **filter** or **sort** the incoming MIDI data and determine which sample(s), if any, should sound in response.\n2. Instruct the Sampler how to **modulate**, or _adapt_, those samples, such as make them quieter or apply a filter.\n\n```\nIncoming MIDI Data ---\u003e Sampler  - - - - - - - - -\u003e Audio Output\n                          |                              ^\n                        SFZ File ---\u003e Sample1.wav        |\n                                 ---\u003e Sample2.wav \u003e\u003e Modulation\n                                 ---\u003e Sample3.wav\n```\n\n## Opcodes\n\nThe primary component of any SFZ file is the opcode. Opcodes essentially define\n'thing=value'. For example, the opcode 'volume=6' defines the volume\nof the sample as +6 decibels relative to normal.\n\nOpcodes functionally perform two different roles: (1) _defining performance parameters_,\nor (2) _restricting the conditions under which that sound may be used_. For example,\n`volume=6` defines a performance property: the sample will sound 6 decibels louder.\nOn the other hand, `lokey=36 hikey=38` limits what condition\nthe sound may play: the key to trigger the sound must be in the range 36 through 38.\n\nYou can think of your SFZ file as a giant conditional filter, which systematically takes a MIDI message and attempts to perform a specific action in response. At the most basic level, if you simply type\n```\n\u003cregion\u003e\nsample=piano.wav\n```\nThen that sample will be mapped to MIDI key 60 (middle C), and be available at ALL velocity ranges, ALL key ranges, and under ALL continuous controller values (i.e. regardless of if sustain pedal is held down or not, for example).\n\nIf we add `lokey=58 hikey=62 pitch_keycenter=60` to the region, then our piano note will ONLY respond if a key within the range 58-62 (Bb to D on either side of middle C) is played. We are restricting the conditions under which that specific sample will be played.\n\nWe can restrict whether or not a specific sample will play by a very wide range of parameters, including which keys are pressed, at what velocity, and what MIDI continuous controller (CC) values are currently present. For example, we can have a piano sample for when the sustain pedal is down AND velocity is less than 20 AND the key pressed is between 58 and 62 as follows:\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003e\nsample=piano.wav\n\npitch_keycenter=60 //here we define the real \"concert\" pitch of the sample, MIDI note 60 or middle C\nlokey=58 //here we set the range of pitches the region will play on\nhikey=62\n\nlovel=1 //here we set the range of key velocities that the region will play on\nhivel=20\n\nlocc64=64 //here we set that the sustain pedal, cc64, must be on for the region to play\nhicc64=127\n```\n\nIf for any reason the MIDI signal DOES NOT meet ALL of the conditions, that sample will not play. That is the basic underlying framework on how SFZ files are organized.\n\n## Headers\n\nHeaders serve to organize and separate opcodes, and are marked with `\u003c` `\u003e`\non either side. There are three primary headers: `\u003cregion\u003e`, `\u003cgroup\u003e`,\nand `\u003cglobal\u003e`, from most to least restrictive. A region, for example,\nmay only contain a single sample. A group is comprised of a series of regions,\neach containing a single sample. A global is comprised of a series of groups,\neach containing a series of regions, etc.\n\n`\u003ccontrol\u003e` is a special purpose header used for a few special opcodes\nsuch as `default_path`.\n\nGenerally SFZ instruments are not indented, but if they were,\nthey would appear as such:\n\n```\n\u003ccontrol\u003e\n\u003cglobal\u003e\n\t\u003cgroup\u003e\n\t\t\u003cregion\u003e\n\t\t\tsample=\n\t\t\u003cregion\u003e\n\t\t\tsample=\n\t\u003cgroup\u003e\n\t\t\u003cregion\u003e\n\t\t\tsample=\n\t\t\u003cregion\u003e\n\t\t\tsample=\n```\n\n### Inheriting\n\nNote that if you entered an opcode between a `\u003cgroup\u003e` and its first `\u003cregion\u003e`,\nthat opcode would be inherited by the `\u003cregion\u003e`s within the group.\nThe same can be done for `\u003cglobal\u003e` as well, with `\u003cglobal\u003e` affecting all of the\n`\u003cgroup\u003e`s within it, and that being passed down to each of the `\u003cregion\u003e`s within\nthose groups as welll, allowing the parameters of dozens,\nhundreds, or thousands of samples to be altered with a single line. This massively\ncuts down on file size, as you do not need to repeat the same text in each item.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nlovel=64 // enter stuff here if you want to apply it to all regions\nhivel=127\n\n\u003cregion\u003e\nsample=Trumpet_C4_v2.wav\nkey=60\n\n\u003cregion\u003e\nsample=Trumpet_C#4_v2.wav\nkey=61\n\n\u003cregion\u003e\nsample=Trumpet_D4_v2.wav\nkey=62\n```\nis the same as:\n```\n\u003cregion\u003e\nsample=Trumpet_C4_v2.wav\nkey=60\nlovel=64\nhivel=127\n\n\u003cregion\u003e\nsample=Trumpet_C#4_v2.wav\nkey=61\nlovel=64\nhivel=127\n\n\u003cregion\u003e\nsample=Trumpet_D4_v2.wav\nkey=62\nlovel=64\nhivel=127\n```\n\nThis behavior can be overriden if that same opcode is specified within\nthe lesser header with a different value. For example:\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003e\n\tvolume=6 //this value will be inherited by everything, unless overriden below\n\n\t\u003cgroup\u003e //Group A\n\t\tvolume=5\n\n\t\t\u003cregion\u003e //Region 1\n\t\t\tvolume=4\n\n\t\t\u003cregion\u003e //Region 2\n\n\t\u003cgroup\u003e //Group B\n\n\t\t\u003cregion\u003e //Region 3\n\t\t\tvolume=2\n\n\t\t\u003cregion\u003e //Region 4\n```\n(indented for clarity; SFZ is not usually indented)\n\nHere's what's going on here:\n\n* Region 1's volume is 4, as it has volume defined.\n* Region 2's volume is 5, as it doesn't have volume defined,\n  so it inherits from Group A, as Group A has volume defined.\n* Region 3's volume is 2, as it has volume defined.\n* Region 4's volume is 6 as it doesn't have volume defined, nor does Group B,\n  so it inherits from the Global volume setting which is 6.\n\nAlways look for opportunities to use inheriting to keep your scripts tidy\nby removing duplicate code.\n\n### Header Nesting\n\nUnlike many popular scripting or programming languages or markup languages like HTML, XML, JSON, etc. there is no such concept as _nesting_ in SFZ. _Nesting_ is when a header of the same type can exist within another header of the same type. Nesting is very useful, but it can add a lot of complexity and layers to a language, and is a common source of bugs or mistakes as well as a slight impediment of speed. The downside to the lack of nesting is that the number of layers is restricted severely rather than infinite. That is why there is both `\u003cgroup\u003e` and `\u003cglobal\u003e`, and the ARIA Player/Sforzando will also use an intermediate between the two, `\u003cmaster\u003e` to provide one more layer.\n\nIn SFZ format, a header ends when the next header of that type is started. For example, if I put a `\u003cregion\u003e` after another `\u003cregion\u003e`, it will end the first region automatically at the start of declaring the next.\n\nKeep in mind that group, global, and master are merely macros to reduce duplicate code. When compiled (in most SFZ players), the SFZ file will run as if everything is inside the regions themselves.\n\n## Organization of Opcodes within Headers\n\nOpcodes may be listed in a row OR one per line, unofficially known as 'condensed' and 'expanded' view:\n```\n\u003cregion\u003e\nsample=piano_D4_vl1.wav\nlokey=62\nhikey=63\npitch_keycenter=62\nlovel=1\nhivel=50\n```\nis equal to:\n```\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=piano_D4_vl1.wav lokey=62 hikey=63 pitch_keycenter=62 lovel=1 hivel=50\n```\n\nYou can see how much space is saved in the latter case, and it allows bulk adjustments to be done easier and makes debugging slightly easier, e.g.:\n```\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=piano_D4_vl1.wav lokey=62 hikey=63 pitch_keycenter=62 lovel=1 hivel=50\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=piano_E4_vl1.wav lokey=64 hikey=65 pitch_keycenter=64 lovel=1 hivel=50\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=piano_F#4_vl1.wav lokey=66 hikey=67 pitch_keycenter=66 lovel=11 hivel=50\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=piano_G#4_vl1.wav lokey=68 hikey=69 pitch_keycenter=68 lovel=1 hivel=50\n```\nYou can see there is something wrong with the third region, a typo of `lovel=11` instaed of `lovel=1`.\n\nThese four lines would replace over 20 lines, making files much more manageable. It is possible to swap between the two by using a find-and-replace operation in your text editor (e.g. Notepad++ or equivalent) to replace new line character with a space (this can be done by selecting a blank line by clicking and dragging down on a blank so that one line is highlighted, _THEN_ open the find/replace dialog and it will be auto-filled in the 'find' field; put a single space in the 'replace with' field. Try executing and see if it works; see the video below for a visual representation of the process).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr7_qS2iV30\n\n## Pitch\n\nIf using a pitch based instrument, you will most likely be working heavily with\nthree opcodes: `lokey`, `hikey`, and `pitch_keycenter`. These opcodes define the range\nof MIDI note numbers or note names that will allow the note to play.\nIt is highly recommended that you use MIDI note numbers, as pitch naming\nconventions are poorly standardized at best.\n\nYou can remember the MIDI note numbers for the C's as follows,\nusing _International Pitch Notation_, which states C4=MIDI note number 60:\n\n```\nC1:24\nC2: 36 (this is the C below bass clef)\nC3: 48 (this is the C in bass clef)\nC4: 60 (this is Middle C)\nC5: 72 (this is the C in treble clef)\nC6: 84 (this is the C above treble clef)\nC7: 96\n```\n\n(note that many, many samplers use a different standard of C3=60,\nin which case all numbers are shifted down one; in fact, this is probably much more commonly found)\n\nYou'll notice each value is exactly 12 notes apart from the others.\nIt's not too difficult to calculate notes between the C's, or keep a chart\non your wall or desk with the note names and MIDI numbers listed out.\nMany hours have been saved debugging and mapping for me in this way.\n\n## Velocity Layers\nFor most instruments, it is possible to perform notes of varying intensity. For classically trained musicians, this might be called _dynamics_ (such as _piano, forte, mezzo-forte,_ etc.). For a piano, when a key is struck with minimal force versus a great deal of force, a rather different tone is emitted, with harder strikes having more higher frequency content present.\n\nIn the MIDI world, we refer to this as _Velocity_, borrowing the term from the world of physics. In the original MIDI spec, velocity has a range of 1-127 (aside: a velocity value of '0' is actually an alias of 'note off' signal, so the actual range is 1-127, not 0-127).\n\nSo, to make a realistic piano (or really most any instrument), it is necessary to sample the tone of the instrument at several different dynamic levels or velocities. We collectively refer to these sets of levels as _Velocity Layers_ or _Dynamic Layers_.\n\nFor example, let us say we record a piano with three such velocity layers. The softest layer might be what a classically trained pianist might call _piano_ or _pianissimo (p or pp_ marking). The moderate layer might be _mezzo-forte (mf)_, and the hardest layer _fortissimo (ff)_.\n\nIn SFZ, we would assign each layer to a velocity range from the 1-127 range. For example, the lowest layer might get the range of 1-50, the medium from 51-100, and the loudest from 101-127.\n\nWe express this in SFZ using lovel and hivel, for example:\n```\n\u003cregion\u003e\nsample=piano_C4_vl1.wav\nlovel=1\nhivel=50\n\n\u003cregion\u003e\nsample=piano_C4_vl2.wav\nlovel=51\nhivel=100\n\n\u003cregion\u003e\nsample=piano_C4_vl3.wav\nlovel=101\nhivel=127\n```\n\nWe would of course also add our `lokey`, `hikey`, and `pitch_keycenter` to these as well if we recorded multiple tones on the instrument.\n\n### Using Velocity with Groups \u0026 Inheriting\n\nTo simplify our lives and keep our SFZ files from being huge, we can also use the `\u003cgroup\u003e` header to organize our velocity layers, for example.\n\nAny `\u003cregion\u003e` within a `\u003cgroup\u003e` will of course inherit whatever is listed in that `\u003cgroup\u003e`, so if we group our samples as shown below, we can significantly cut down on the amount of space needed in the file:\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e //velocity layer 1 (pp)\nlovel=1\nhivel=50\n\n\u003cregion\u003e //C4\nsample=piano_C4_vl1.wav\nlokey=60\nhikey=61\npitch_keycenter=60\n\n\u003cregion\u003e //D4\nsample=piano_D4_vl1.wav\nlokey=62\nhikey=63\npitch_keycenter=62\n\n\u003cregion\u003e //E4\nsample=piano_E4_vl1.wav\nlokey=64\nhikey=64\npitch_keycenter=64\n\n\u003cregion\u003e //F4\nsample=piano_F4_vl1.wav\nlokey=65\nhikey=66\npitch_keycenter=65\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e //velocity layer 2 (mf)\nlovel=51\nhivel=100\n\n\u003cregion\u003e //C4\nsample=piano_C4_vl2.wav\nlokey=60\nhikey=61\npitch_keycenter=60\n\n\u003cregion\u003e //D4\nsample=piano_D4_vl2.wav\nlokey=62\nhikey=63\npitch_keycenter=62\n\n\u003cregion\u003e //E4\nsample=piano_E4_vl2.wav\nlokey=64\nhikey=64\npitch_keycenter=64\n\n\u003cregion\u003e //F4\nsample=piano_F4_vl2.wav\nlokey=65\nhikey=66\npitch_keycenter=65\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e //velocity layer 3 (ff)\nlovel=101\nhivel=127\n\n\u003cregion\u003e //C4\nsample=piano_C4_vl3.wav\nlokey=60\nhikey=61\npitch_keycenter=60\n\n\u003cregion\u003e //D4\nsample=piano_D4_vl3.wav\nlokey=62\nhikey=63\npitch_keycenter=62\n\n\u003cregion\u003e //E4\nsample=piano_E4_vl3.wav\nlokey=64\nhikey=64\npitch_keycenter=64\n\n\u003cregion\u003e //F4\nsample=piano_F4_vl3.wav\nlokey=65\nhikey=66\npitch_keycenter=65\n```\n\nKeep in mind of course that we can always override the inheriting behavior here, such as in the case of a sample for which only two velocity layers were recorded. This might happen in the case of a mistake, or in the case where time was running short in the session, or in some cases where the instrument physically has less distinction between its quietest and loudest sounds and it was desirable to save some time.\n\nYou can also use group, master, and global to organize other things than velocity layers, such as keys, sustain pedal state, round robins, mic positions, and more. Just be careful as in some cases you might run out of headers to use if the file gets too complex, such as if you are using multiple mic positions, round robins, and grouping your velocity layers as well.\n\n## Includes\n\nOne final more advanced topic to discuss is Includes. Perhaps the dark magic of SFZ, `#include` allows you to take the contents of one SFZ file and import them into your current file. This allows another layer of organiziation to take place, with, for example, all of the samples for each drum in a drum kit to exist in a separate .sfz file without an assigned key range, and a single master .sfz file to inherit each of those into a `\u003cgroup\u003e` where their key range is assigned (see Virtuosity Drums as a good example of this process). This might also be useful for an acoustic instrument to organize by mic position or articulation.\n\nThis allows you to keep an extremely tidy workflow, creating easily-managed main files where you can rapidly change key ranges and other control values to get the controls you need.\n"},{"slug":["brush_stirs"],"title":"Brush stirs","content":"Not all drum sounds are hits which can be used in the usual way described in our [drum basics](/tutorials/drum_basics)\narticle. One major exception are brush techniques which involve scraping the\nbrush across a drum head, often in a circle. If you are not sure what this\nlooks or sounds like, [this video is a good guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R982CdhRF9E).\nThese techniques are called swirls or stirs, and for the purpose of this article\nwe'll call them stirs. As the sound changes in intensity, and the duration\nof the scrapes needs to fit the tempo and rhythm of the song, sampling them\nrequires a different approach to the usual drum hits. The two common approaches\nare to completely ignore this technique and not sample it at all, and to record\nloops to fit various tempos.\n\nThis article describes another approach. The key principle here\nis that stirs are a noisy, nonlinear sound with a lot of randomness, which\nmakes them very easy to crossfade or loop with no phase issues. Therefore,\ninstead of trying to record stirs performed in a realistic way, we propose\nrecording long, unrealistically steady stirs with no perceptible rhythm or\nexpression, and then using those samples as source material for building up\na musical stir.\n\n## Recording the source material\n\nFor the purposes of this example, let's assume the source stirs are recorded\nat four speeds, with 1 being the slowest and 4 being the fastest. Speed 1 is\nslow enough that a full circle around the head of the drum is completed in\nmore than 4 seconds. That's enough to fill a measure at 60 bpm and still have\nsome sound left, so the user can start the next stir before the previous one\nends, and thus achieve a continuous sound. Speed 4 is several circles per\nsecond, to match the speed at which the brush would be moving during the peak\nof an aggressive stir. Making the sound steady at this speed is a challenge.\n\nAs for how long the recordings need to be, speed 1 needs to be long enough\nfor the longest stir we want to be able to make. However, if tuning controls\nare to be applied, it's important to remember that pitching a sample up\nshortens it, so if the tuning range is to extend to one octave up, then a\n10-second sample is the minimum to make a 5-second stir. Speeds 3 and 4\nare not used thorughout the duration of a stir but only for peaks, and for\nthe purposes of this example they can be half the length of speed 1.\n\n## Simple stir model\n\nWe can make a very simple stir using speed 1 by playing the sample with\n[loop_mode](/opcodes/loop_mode) set to one_shot, like we normally would set it for a\ndrum hit, and using a simple [volume envelope](/modulations/envelope_generators#sfz-1-egs)\nto fade this sample in over a time, and then fade it out.\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=26 loop_mode=one_shot\nsample=snare_stir_speed_1.wav\nampeg_attack=1.0 ampeg_decay=1.0 ampeg_sustain=0\n```\n\nThe resulting volume envelope will look something like this. The illustrations are\nnot precise, only general shapes.\n\n{%include img-fluid.liquid\n  img=\"/assets/img/tutorials/brush_stirs/stir1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Simple stir envelope\"%}\n\nThis is a good start, and we can add expression and realism by layering a\nfaster speed on top of it near the stir's peak, with half the duration\nof the base layer. We use ampeg_delay to delay the start of the second\nlayer by the same amount, so the peaks of both layers align in time.\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=26 loop_mode=one_shot\nsample=snare_stir_speed_1.wav\nampeg_attack=1.0 ampeg_decay=1.0 ampeg_sustain=0\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=26 loop_mode=one_shot\nsample=snare_stir_speed_3.wav\nampeg_delay=0.5 ampeg_attack=0.5 ampeg_decay=0.5 ampeg_sustain=0\n```\n\n{%include img-fluid.liquid\n  img=\"/assets/img/tutorials/brush_stirs/stir2.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Two layer stir envelopes\"%}\n\n## Modulating stir duration\n\nThis has a fixed duration and is not flexible, but the stir length can\neasily be modulated by a single CC parameter changing all the\nenvelope durations. Extremely short stirs, lasting only a small fraction\nof a second, are obviously not going to sound realistic, so we can use\na minimum value to prevent that. Let's use CC1 (standard mod wheel).\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=26 loop_mode=one_shot\nsample=snare_stir_speed_1.wav\nampeg_attack=0.1 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0\nampeg_attackcc1=0.4 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=26 loop_mode=one_shot\nsample=snare_stir_speed_3.wav\nampeg_delay=0.05 ampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0\nampeg_delaycc1=0.25 ampeg_attackcc1=0.25 ampeg_decaycc1=0.25\n```\n\n## Making the shape more realistic\n\nDrummers testing the above model have asked for some adjustments to\nmake it sound more realistic. One is to make the first half of the base\nlayer steadier. This can be done very easily by shortening the attack\nand adding a hold time to the envelope, ensuring that they still add up\nto the same amount of time that the faster layer's delay and attack,\nso the peak will remain aligned at all values of the modulation\nparameter. The attack stage should generally be shorter than the hold\nstage.\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=26 loop_mode=one_shot\nsample=snare_stir_speed_1.wav\nampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_hold=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0\nampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_holdcc1=0.35 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=26 loop_mode=one_shot\nsample=snare_stir_speed_3.wav\nampeg_delay=0.05 ampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0\nampeg_delaycc1=0.25 ampeg_attackcc1=0.25 ampeg_decaycc1=0.25\n```\n\n{%include img-fluid.liquid\n  img=\"/assets/img/tutorials/brush_stirs/stir3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Stir envelopes using hold in base layer\"%}\n\nAlso, the peak should be sharper and more accented than it is\nwith linear envelopes. Changing the envelope curves accomplishes this,\nthough the initial attack envelope of the base layer can remain\nlinear. The below values seem like a decent start.\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=26 loop_mode=one_shot\nsample=snare_stir_speed_1.wav\nampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_hold=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0\nampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_holdcc1=0.35 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4\nampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=26 loop_mode=one_shot\nsample=snare_stir_speed_3.wav\nampeg_delay=0.05 ampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0\nampeg_delaycc1=0.25 ampeg_attackcc1=0.25 ampeg_decaycc1=0.25\nampeg_attack_shape=3.5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4\n```\n\n{%include img-fluid.liquid\n  img=\"/assets/img/tutorials/brush_stirs/stir4.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Stir envelopes with curves\"%}\n\n## Adjusting the envelope shapes\n\nThe above fixed envelope shapes are good for medium tempos and energy levels,\nbut for slow tempos the flat envelope shapes actually work quite well, and\nmore energetic tracks might sound better with even sharper envelope peaks. It\nwould be nice to adjust the envelope curve shapes with MIDI CC, but it is not\ncurrently possible to do this. It's possible to work around this by crossfading\nsharp-envelope and flat-envelope regions, or use locc/hicc to select between\nseveral pre-baked [envelope shapes](/opcodes/ampeg_attack_shape).

More complex patterns can have more than one peak,\nthough. A simple way to emulate that is to use a differnet MIDI note\nto trigger short ornaments which will add a brief extra sound to the\nstir, thus emulating a momentary acceleration of the brush. We can use\none of the higher stir speeds for this.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003ekey=27 loop_mode=one_shot sample=snare_stir_speed_2.wav\nampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0\nampeg_attackcc1=0.2 ampeg_decaycc1=0.2\n\n\u003cregion\u003ehicc100=42\nampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=0.0\n\n\u003cregion\u003ehicc100=42\nampeg_attack_shape=3.5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4\n\n\u003cregion\u003ehicc100=42\nampeg_attack_shape=5.2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3.5\n```\n\n## Accents\n\nWe can also create accents, which are similar to the typical stir but peak much\nmore quickly and use faster speeds. In pracitce, they can be used either as\nshort, aggressive stirs, or added on top of basic stirs to create more complex\npatterns. The difference in the SFZ here is that the attack curve shape can be applied to\nthe attack portion as well, and there is no hold stage in the envelope.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003ekey=28 loop_mode=one_shot\n\n\u003cregion\u003ehicc100=42\nsample=snare_stir_speed_2.wav\nampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0\nampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4\nampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=0.0\n\u003cregion\u003ehicc100=42\nsample=snare_stir_speed_4.wav\nampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0\nampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.2\nampeg_attack_shape=0.0 ampeg_decay_shape=0.0\n\n\u003cregion\u003elocc100=43 hicc100=86\nsample=snare_stir_speed_2.wav\nampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0\nampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4\nampeg_attack_shape=3.5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4\n\u003cregion\u003elocc100=43 hicc100=86\nsample=snare_stir_speed_4.wav\nampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0\nampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.2\nampeg_attack_shape=3.5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4\n\n\u003cregion\u003elocc100=87\nsample=snare_stir_speed_2.wav\nampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.1 ampeg_sustain=0\nampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.4\nampeg_attack_shape=5.2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3.5\n\u003cregion\u003elocc100=87\nsample=snare_stir_speed_4.wav\nampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_decay=0.05 ampeg_sustain=0\nampeg_attackcc1=0.05 ampeg_decaycc1=0.2\nampeg_attack_shape=5.2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3.5\n```\n\n## Muting\n\nAs all the above sounds have loop_mode set to one_shot, triggering a note causes\nthe sound to play until the volume envelope drops to zero. If ending a stir\nearlier than that is required, we can use polyphony groups. The [group](/opcodes/group) and [off_by](/opcodes/off_by)\nopcodes are the key ones here. We can use them to make stirs self-mute, so that\ntriggering a new stir will mute any previously playing stirs, as well as add a key\nwhich produces no sound, using [silence instead of a sample](/opcodes/sample), but\nis in the same mute groups, so triggering this key will mute any stir or accent\ncurrently playing.

That is left as an exercise to the reader.\n\n## Alternative approach\n\nThe above approach was developed to be playable from an electronic drum kit\ncontroller. For keyboard controllers or sequencing, another approach is possible\nwhere instead of using a MIDI note to trigger a new stir every time the drummer\nwould complete a circle, we hold down a long note for as long as we want to produce\nstirs (so, possibly for several measures, or even the entire duration of a song).\nWe then [use MIDI CC to crossfade between the layers](/opcodes/xfin_loccN) to\nmodulate the speed of the stir in order to create realism and rhythmic interest.\nIn order to be able to do this, the samples will have to be looped, but as stated\nat the beginning, looping or crossfading noisy samples is very easy as there are\nno phase issues. We also set the [loop_mode](/opcodes/loop_mode) opcode to continuous\ninstead of the one_shot setting used in the earlier approach.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003ekey=26 loop_mode=continuous ampeg_release=0.25\n\u003cregion\u003esample=snare_stir_speed_1.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=31 xfout_locc1=32 xfout_hicc1=63\n\u003cregion\u003esample=snare_stir_speed_2.wav xfin_locc1=32 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=95\n\u003cregion\u003esample=snare_stir_speed_3.wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=95 xfout_locc1=96 xfout_hicc1=127\n\u003cregion\u003esample=snare_stir_speed_4.wav xfin_locc1=96 xfin_hicc1=127\n```\n\nIn practice, this approach has proven more difficult to use, with it being easy\nto sound obviously unrealistic by moving the MIDI CC parameter too quickly or\nstaying at high values for too long. With care, however, it can produce realistic\nresults, and it is extremely flexible.\n\n## Further possibilities\n\nThe brush flutter technique can be treated similarly to the base layer of the stirs.\nThere is no need to layer faster and slower flutters. In theory, this approach\ncould also be extended to other noisy, highly nonlinear sounds which can vary\nin duration - perhaps shakers. The main challenge there would be to record shakers\nshaking smoothly for an extended duration.\n\nIt is also certainly possible to further improve the above model with more realism\nand playablity.\n"},{"slug":["cymbal_muting"],"title":"Cymbal muting","content":"A lot of the information in this article deals with implementing sampled hi-hats\nand cymbals in general, and although the code examples are in SFZ, the principles\nshould also apply to other samplers, or even synthesized cymbals.\nMuting previously played notes is important with monophonic instruments, such as\nflutes or trumpets. With hi-hats, it is also crucial to sounding like a hi-hat -\nan open hi-hat hit will be muted in real life when the hi-hat pedal is closed.\nLet's start with a simple hi-hat with closed hit, foot chik, half-open and open\nsamples, with the latter two on the same key and degree of openness selected by\nMIDI CC 4 - the common hi-hat pedal assignment in electronic drum kits.\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=42 sample=hh_closed.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=44 sample=hh_chik.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_half_open.wav hicc4=63\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_open.wav locc4=64\n```\n\n## Simple self-muting\n\nThe above hi-hat has no muting implemented, so playing\na closed hit after an open one would result in the open hit unrealistically\ncontinuing to ring. The simplest way to take care of that is to put all the\nregions in the same ‹[group](/headers/group)› and use [off_by](/opcodes/off_by)\nto make that group mute itself - that\nwill mean any hi-hat hit will mute any currently playing hi-hat hit.\nSetting [off_mode](/opcodes/off_mode) to normal and using [ampeg_release](/opcodes/ampeg_release)\nor [off_time](/opcodes/off_time) to set the time it takes for\nthe previous sample to fade out also helps this sound a bit more natural.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\noff_mode=normal\nampeg_release=0.07\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=42 sample=hh_closed.wav group=1 off_by=1\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=44 sample=hh_chik.wav group=1 off_by=1\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_half_open.wav hicc4=63 group=1 off_by=1\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_open.wav locc4=64 group=1 off_by=1\n```\n\n## Hierarchical self-muting\n\nThis is the way many virtual drum kits work, but it is not fully satisfactory if,\nfor example, playing a ride pattern on an open hi-hat. Things do start getting more\ncomplicated here, though, and many developers feel that it's enough to stop here, just\nimplement the above rules, and have a reasonably working virtual hi-hat. For those\nwho want more, however, Peter L. Jones has developed a hierarchy of muting, where\nhits which are more closed mute hits that are more open, but hits which are\nmore open do not mute hits which are more closed. Hits also don't mute hits with\nthe same degree of openness.\n\nSo, chiks mute all hits, closed hits mute any partially open hits but not chiks\nor closed hits etc. With this amount of degrees of openness, half-open hits would\nmute open hits, and open hits would mute nothing. So, we need to put each hi-hat\narticulation in a different group. This, however, means we need a group which\nmutes several other groups, and regions in a group cannot have multiple or\nvarying off_by values. So, what we have to do is use silence - either the silence*\nsetting of [sample](/opcodes/sample) ARIA extension, or an actual file of\na short silence. Note that the silence samples also have to have off_by settings\nthe same as the hi-hat samples in their mute group. Also, since group 1 doesn't\nmute anything, we don't need to add any silence regions to that group.\nNote that the [group](/opcodes/group) opcode used here and the ‹[group](/headers/group)›\nheader are completely separate concepts - \"group\" for the remainder of this\narticle refers to the opcode, not the header, though group headers are also used\nin the code examples.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\n// Here are the hi-hat samples\noff_mode=normal\nampeg_release=0.07\n\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=42 sample=hh_closed.wav group=3 off_by=4\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=44 sample=hh_chik.wav group=4\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_half_open.wav hicc4=63 group=2 off_by=3\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_open.wav locc4=64 group=1 off_by=2\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=2 off_by=3\n// The range which mutes open hi-hats - that is, everything except open\nsample=*silence\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=42\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n\u003cregion\u003e key=46 hicc4=63\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=3 off_by=4\n// The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed and chik\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=42\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=4\n// The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chik\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n```\n\n## Special treatment of foot splashes\n\nThe above isn't perfect - for example, fully opening up a hi-hat after playing\na hard half-open hit in the real world would stop the clashes between the top\nand bottom, effectively stopping a half-open sound and replacing it with quieter\nopen ringing - but it is a reasonable compromise covering various degrees of\nopenness. Also, the more degrees of openness there are, the more groups will be needed.\n\nThere are, however, more hi-hat articulations possible. One which has special\nbehavior when it comes to muting is the foot splash - closing the hi-hat with\nthe pedal, then quickly reopening it. This articulation needs to mute itself,\nbecause playing one foot splash after another involves closing the hi-hat, which\nwill mute the ringing.\n\nWhether the splash should mute other types of hits is an open question, however.\nSplashes, especially gentler ones, involve only momentary contact of the cymbal\nedges and not complete closure. Whether an open hi-hat hit followed by a splash\nsounds better when the splash mutes the open hit is left as a decision to the\nreader.\n\nThe below example has the splash muting everything else, except for pedal chiks,\nbecause it invovles closing the hi-hat fully. So, if a\nkit has foot splash samples (for which there is no standard general MIDI note\nassignment, so let's use 54 here - an octave above the chik, though in general\nMIDI that's supposed to be the cowbell note), we'd need to set up one more group,\nand have that mute itself. It will also need to be muted by all other types of\nhi-hat hits, except for fully open hits.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\n//Here are the hi-hat samples\noff_mode=normal\nampeg_release=0.07\n\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=42 sample=hh_closed.wav group=4 off_by=5\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=44 sample=hh_chik.wav group=5\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_half_open.wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_open.wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=54 sample=hh_splash.wav group=1 off_by=1\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=1 off_by=1\n//The range which mutes foot splashes - everything except open and foot splash\n//Foot splash mutes itself, but this group does not include the foot splash key\n//That's because the foot splash samples themselves are in the same group\nsample=*silence\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=42\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n\u003cregion\u003e key=46\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=3 off_by=4\n//The range which mutes open hi-hats - that is, everything except open\nsample=*silence\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=42\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n\u003cregion\u003e key=46 hicc4=63\n\u003cregion\u003e key=54\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=4 off_by=5\n//The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed, chik and foot splash\nsample=*silence\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=42\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n\u003cregion\u003e key=54\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=5\n//The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chik and foot splash\nsample=*silence\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n\u003cregion\u003e key=54\n```\n\n## Limiting polyphony\n\nThis works reasonably well. Another potential refinement is to also avoid\nexcessive buildup when the more open articulations (which with some hi-hat pairs\ncan ring for upwards of 20 seconds), while still allowing enough for ride\npatterns on an open hi-hat to sound right. We can do this by using the [polyphony](/opcodes/polyphony)\nopcode to put a limit on the number of polyphony voices used by a specific group.\nNote this must be set for the silence regions, also, so that every region in a\ngroup will have the same off_by and polyphony as all the other regions in that\ngroup. Polyphony of 4 for the open hi-hats and 3 for the half-open are judgment\ncalls. Drier cymbals and articulations with less sustain will generally sound\nrealistic with lower numbers here, and brushes might need a lower number than\nsticks. Limiting the polyphony for the more closed articulations is not necessary\nin practice, unless playing unrealistically dense trap hi-hat patterns, because\nthey don't ring very long anyway. Limiting the polyphony for the foot splash is\nnot necessary at all, because it mutes itself.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\n//Here are the hi-hat samples\noff_mode=normal\nampeg_release=0.07\n\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=42 sample=hh_closed.wav group=4 off_by=5\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=44 sample=hh_chik.wav group=5\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_half_open.wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=3\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_open.wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 polyphony=4\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=54 sample=hh_splash.wav group=1 off_by=1\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=1 off_by=1\n//The range which mutes foot splashes\n//All sounds except open mute foot splashes, but this group does not include the foot splash key\n//That's because the foot splash samples are in the same group, and will mute anything else\nsample=*silence\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=42\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n\u003cregion\u003e key=46 hicc4=63\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=3 off_by=4 polyphony=3\n//The range which mutes open hi-hats - that is, everything except open and foot splash\nsample=*silence\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=42\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n\u003cregion\u003e key=46 hicc4=63\n\u003cregion\u003e key=54\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=4 off_by=5\n//The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed, chik and foot splash\nsample=*silence\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=42\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n\u003cregion\u003e key=54\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=5\n//The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chik and foot splash\nsample=*silence\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n```\n\n## Edge cases\n\nThe above can sound strange when a hard hi-hat hit is being muted by a much quieter one. If\nthe hit doing the muting is both quiet and short, it can be practically inaudible, and the\nresulting sound seems to only be the open hit, suddenly fading out. This is especially risky\nif using amp_veltrack set to 100, which will make hits with very low velocity extremely quiet,\nor if the lowest dynamic layers of more closed hits and foot chiks are recorded very quietly.\n\nLowering amp_veltrack for the lowest velocity layers is one potential way to reduce this\nproblem, as is setting amp_velcurve_1 to some value around 0.2 to 0.5 (higher values if there\nare more dynamic layers).\n\nIn real life, however, a hard open hi-hat hit would have reduced in volume before the start\nof the soft closed hit, as the pedal needs to be closed before a closed hit can be made.\nThis would, of course, cause many edge clashes along the way, which we do not have a way\nto emulate. However, it is possible to use the pedal's MIDI CC to make the open sample quieter\noutside of the range where the open hi-hat sample would be triggered. This can be done by modulating\nthe hi-hat's [amplitude](/opcodes/amplitude), and applying a [curve](/headers/curve) which will\nkeep the amplitude at 100% unless the pedal is a good deal more closed than it was when the sample\nwas triggered.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\n//Here are the hi-hat samples\noff_mode=normal\nampeg_release=0.07\n\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=42 sample=hh_closed.wav group=4 off_by=5\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=44 sample=hh_chik.wav group=5\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_half_open.wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 amplitude_cc4=100 amplitude_curvecc4=21 amplitude_smoothcc4=150\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_open.wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 amplitude_cc4=100 amplitude_curvecc4=21 amplitude_smoothcc4=150\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=54 sample=hh_splash.wav group=1 off_by=1\n\n\u003ccurve\u003ecurve_index=21\nv000=0.13\nv037=0.8\nv077=1\nv127=1\n\n\u003ccurve\u003ecurve_index=22\nv000=0.1\nv037=0.7\nv077=1\nv127=1\n```\n\nUsing smoothing on the amplitude modulation helps avoid sudden jumps, though playing an\nopen hit, closing the hi-hat pedal most of the way and then reopening it will still\nresult in obviously unrealistic volume fluctuations. So, this is not a perfect solution\nby any means.\n\nIt's probably better to do this by using a volume envelope and using CC4 to modulate its\ndecay time, with the sustain set to a low level. and the [ampeg_dynamic](/opcodes/ampeg_dynamic)\nopcode set to 1 so that moving the pedal will cause the decay time to be recalculated.\nHowever, that has not been tested yet, as the author's test kit was already using envelopes\non the hi-hat to emulate drier cymbals.\n\nAlso, applying this to splash samples, which involve the pedal starting closed and opening\nrapidly, is another problem which requires a solution.\n\n## Multimic samples\n\nSo far, each hi-hat articulation has only one sample, which will obviously not\nbe the case in most virtual drum kits. This does not add much complexity, though,\nas the samples for each degree of openness simply need to all be in the same group.\nAll half-open samples, for example, including all round robins, all velocity layers,\ncan share the same group.\n\nIf there are separate articulations for each degree of openness, such as shank,\ntip and bell, those can also all be on the same group. Brushes, sticks and\nmallets can often also share the same groups, unless the brushes need lower\npolyphony numbers. However, if there are separate samples for different\nmicrophones and the groups are self-muting, they will need to be in different\ngroups. In the current example, only the footsplash is self-muting, but if using\nthe simpler rules where all hi-hat articulations mute all others, all groups are\nself-muting. So, having separate close hi-hat mic and a stereo overhead pair\nwould mean twice as many of those groups (assuming the stereo overheads are in\nthe L and R channel of the same sample), and close hi-hat, stereo overheads,\nclose room and far room would mean four times as many. The polyphony numbers for\ngroups which have polyphony will also have to be multiplied by the same factor.\nHere is an example with close and overhead, with slightly longer fadeout times\nfor the more distant overhead mics:\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\n//Here are the hi-hat samples\noff_mode=normal\n\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=42 sample=hh_closed_close.wav group=4 off_by=5 ampeg_release=0.12\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=42 sample=hh_closed_oh.wav group=4 off_by=5 ampeg_release=0.2\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=44 sample=hh_chik_close.wav group=5 ampeg_release=0.12\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=44 sample=hh_chik_oh.wav group=5 ampeg_release=0.2\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_half_open_close.wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0.12\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_half_open_oh.wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0.2\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_open_close.wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 polyphony=8 ampeg_release=0.12\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=46 sample=hh_open_oh.wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 polyphony=8 ampeg_release=0.2\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=54 sample=hh_splash_close.wav group=1 off_by=1 ampeg_release=0.12\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=54 sample=hh_splash_oh.wav group=11 off_by=11 ampeg_release=0.2\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=1 off_by=1\n//The range which mutes foot splashes for the close mic\n//All sounds except open mute foot splashes, but this group does not include the foot splash key\n//That's because the foot splash samples are in the same group, and will mute anything else\nsample=*silence\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=42\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n\u003cregion\u003e key=46 hicc4=63\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=11 off_by=11\n//The range which mutes foot splashes for the overhead mics\n//All sounds mute foot splashes, but this group does not include the foot splash key\n//That's because the foot splash samples are in the same group, and will mute anything else\nsample=*silence\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=42\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n\u003cregion\u003e key=46 hicc4=63\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=3 off_by=4 polyphony=3\n//The range which mutes open hi-hats for both close and overhead mics - that is, everything except open\nsample=*silence\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=42\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n\u003cregion\u003e key=46 hicc4=63\n\u003cregion\u003e key=54\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=4 off_by=5\n//The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed, chik and foot splash\nsample=*silence\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=42\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n\u003cregion\u003e key=54\n\n\u003cgroup\u003egroup=5\n//The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chik\nsample=*silence\nloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fast\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\nampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0\n\u003cregion\u003e key=44\n```\n\n## Header organization\n\nThat is as complex as it gets, though there are a few minor points to be aware of.\nMany drum kits with round robins will set [seq_length](/opcodes/seq_length)\nat the ‹[global](/headers/global)› level, and in those cases, the silence regions\nwould only trigger for the first hit in the round robin sequence, unless they\nhave seq_length set to 1 to override the global setting. Also, the ‹[master](/headers/master)›\nheader level and #[include](/opcodes/include) statement are useful ARIA\nextensions for keeping deeply sampled hi-hat mappings organized.\n\n## Cymbals other than hi-hats\n\nCymbals other than hi-hats are simpler, but there are\ntwo considerations when muting those. One is limiting polyphony, which is\nespecially important with cymbals intended for playing rolls, and with jazz ride\ncymbals (rock/metal rides which primarily use the bell articulation, not as much).\nThe other is that it's also possible to record separate choke samples, and have\nthose mute everything else. A ride with bell, bow and edge articulations, choke\nsamples and overhead and room mics might be set up like below. Note that while\neach articulation has its own groups and different polyphony limits, all\narticulations for each mic have the same off_by value, which is the group value\nof the choke samples for that mic. It would not be necessary to have this many\ngroups to implement muting, but this setup would also allow a mapping using only\nthe overhead mics and no room mic to be created without breaking anything, as\neach mic's samples have separate groups. Having different polyphony numbers for\ndifferent mics can result in an inconsistent sound, so it is not recommended.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\noff_mode=normal\n\n//Bow hits\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=51 group=30 off_by=33 polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0.3\nsample=ride_bow_oh.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=51 group=40 off_by=43 polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0.4\nsample=ride_bow_rm.wav\n\n//Bell hits\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=53 group=31 off_by=33 polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0.3\nsample=ride_bell_oh.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=53 group=41 off_by=43 polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0.4\nsample=ride_bell_rm.wav\n\n//Edge hits (crashes)\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=59 group=32 off_by=33 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0.3\nsample=ride_edge_oh.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=59 group=42 off_by=43 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0.4\nsample=ride_edge_rm.wav\n\n//Edge chokes\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=71 ampeg_attack=0.15 group=33\nsample=ride_choke_oh.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=71 ampeg_attack=0.15 group=43\nsample=ride_choke_rm.wav\n```\n\nIt is also possible to use \u003c[note_polyphony]\u003e(/opcodes/note_polyphony) here, which\nhas the advantage of allowing \u003c[note_selfmask]\u003e(/opcodes/note_selfmask) to be used. This\nis good when a hard hit is followed by several lighter ones on the same cymbal - using\npolyphony, the quieter hits will mute the loud one when the polyphony\nlimit is reached, which can result in the louder hit's sustain suddenly and unrealistically\nvanishing. However, this can cause problems with hi-hats where one MIDI note needs to\ntrigger several silence groups as well. This is why Virtuosity Drums has the\nhi-hat regions set with note_polyphony=MAX, though there might be a better way.\n\nNote_polyphony is also separated by keys; while the polyphony limit under a\ngroup can be tracked together for several keys under one group, note_polyphony\nis tracked separately for each MIDI note value.\n\nThe above example modified to use note_polyphony instead of polyphony would look\nlike this:\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\noff_mode=normal\n\n//Bow hits\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=51 group=30 off_by=33 note_polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0.3\nsample=ride_bow_oh.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=51 group=40 off_by=43 note_polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0.4\nsample=ride_bow_rm.wav\n\n//Bell hits\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=53 group=31 off_by=33 note_polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0.3\nsample=ride_bell_oh.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=53 group=41 off_by=43 note_polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0.4\nsample=ride_bell_rm.wav\n\n//Edge hits (crashes)\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=59 group=32 off_by=33 note_polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0.3\nsample=ride_edge_oh.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=59 group=42 off_by=43 note_polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0.4\nsample=ride_edge_rm.wav\n\n//Edge chokes\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=71 ampeg_attack=0.15 group=33\nsample=ride_choke_oh.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=71 ampeg_attack=0.15 group=43\nsample=ride_choke_rm.wav\n```\n\n\n## Another approach to limiting polyphony\n\nIf there is no need have a choke group, it's possible to limit the polyphony of\na cymbal in a way which is more controllable, by having it self-mute but making\nthe fadeout time of the previous samples long. This cannot be done when chokes\nare required, because chokes need a fast fadeout, but it is another option which\nallows how much dense patterns on a cymbal will build up to be controlled with a\nMIDI CC parameter - the polyphony opcode cannot be modulated by MIDI CC, but\nampeg_release can. Here is how that might work using CC 100 to modulate the time,\nwith different maximum times for different articulations, as in general edge hits\nwill build up the most and bell hits the least. Of course, it's not very possible\nto modulate the buildup of a cymbal in the real world, but that doesn't mean it\ncan't be useful in the sampled world.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\noff_mode=normal\nampeg_release=0.1\n\n//Bow hits\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=51 group=30 off_by=30\nampeg_release_oncc100=5\nsample=ride_bow_oh.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=51 group=40 off_by=40\nampeg_release_oncc100=5.7\nsample=ride_bow_rm.wav\n\n//Bell hits\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=53 group=31 off_by=31\nampeg_release_oncc100=3\nsample=ride_bell_oh.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=53 group=41 off_by=41\nampeg_release_oncc100=3.5\nsample=ride_bell_rm.wav\n\n//Edge hits (crashes)\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=59 group=32 off_by=32\nampeg_release_oncc100=7\nsample=ride_edge_oh.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=59 group=42 off_by=42\nampeg_release_oncc100=8\nsample=ride_edge_rm.wav\n```\n\n## Deep-sampled hi-hat example\n\nPutting most of the above knowledge together into a complex example can result\nin long SFZ files, but the principles themselves remain the same.

basics","content":"SFZ has a lot of opcodes. No instrument uses all of them, though, and even highly\ncomplicated instruments with thousands of samples will usually only use a dozen\nor two different opcodes.\n\nIn this guide, we'll talk about the opcodes needed to make a simple drum kit.\nIf you have some drum samples, a text editor and an SFZ player, this should be\nall the knowledge you need to make a working SFZ mapping for those samples.\nMost of them will apply to most other instrument types as well. Later, we'll\napply this knowledge to instruments such as piano, guitar, violin and flute.\n\nA very simple instrument to make would be an electronic drum kit with one sample\nfor each sound. A functional mapping for an entire sampled drum machine using\none-shot samples could be made using only the region header, and two opcodes\n[sample](/opcodes/sample) and [key](/opcodes/key). With kick, snare\nand hi-hat samples on their standard General MIDI notes, this could be the\nentire SFZ file:\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=36 sample=kick.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=38 sample=snare.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=42 sample=closedhat.wav\n```\n\nThis would work. Load this into an SFZ player, hit the C on MIDI note 36, and\nyou get the kick sample playing. However, each sound would play only while a\nnote is held. With drums it's usually a good idea to play the entire sample, so\na very short note will result in a complete drum hit sounding. We can do that\nwith the [loop_mode](/opcodes/loop_mode) opcode, which is also used for\nlooping (as the name implies), but `loop_mode=one_shot` causes the sampler to\nplay the entire sample from start to end, ignoring note off.\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=36 loop_mode=one_shot sample=kick.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=38 loop_mode=one_shot sample=snare.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=42 loop_mode=one_shot sample=closedhat.wav\n```\n\nThere's no need to set the one_shot for each region, though. We can simplify\nour life by using the ‹[global](/headers/global)› header like this:\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003eloop_mode=one_shot\n\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=36 sample=kick.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=38 sample=snare.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=42 sample=closedhat.wav\n```\n\nThis is basically all that's required to take, for example, some of\nWave Alchemy's very nice free samples of TR-808 or Tanzbar drum machines,\nand make a working SFZ mapping for them.\n\n*Let's say what we have isn't drum machine samples, but acoustic drum samples.\nThese sounds will have natural variation between hits - some depending on hit\nlocation, a lot depending on dynamics (how hard the drum is hit), and some just\nplain random. Let's ignore controlling hit location for now (drum samples mostly\ndo ignore it), and focus on the other two. Dynamic variation can be captured by\nrecording hits of various intensity, and organizing them into dynamic layers,\nalso called velocity layers.*\n\nIf we have an acoustic kick drum sampled at four dynamics - quiet, kind of quiet,\nkind of loud and loud - we have four dynamic layers. Let's say the files for\nthese layers are named like this:\n\n```\nkick_vl1.wav\nkick_vl2.wav\nkick_vl3.wav\nkick_vl4.wav\n```\n\nTo trigger the quiet sample at low MIDI note velocities, we'd use the\n[lovel and hivel](/opcodes/lovel) opcodes like this:\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=36 lovel=0 hivel=31 sample=kick_vl1.wav\n```\n\nAll four hits with velocity ranges assigned, evenly splitting the full 0 to 127\nvelocity range into four, would look like this:\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=36\nlovel=0 hivel=31\nsample=kick_vl1.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=36\nlovel=32 hivel=63\nsample=kick_vl2.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=36\nlovel=64 hivel=95\nsample=kick_vl3.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=36\nlovel=96 hivel=127\nsample=kick_vl4.wav\n```\nThis can, again, be simplified. The defalut value for lovel is 0, and for hivel\nit's 127, so we don't need to specify setting them to those numbers. Also, we\ncan use a ‹[group](/headers/group)› header to make the key opcode the same\nacross all four regions:\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003eloop_mode=one_shot\n\n\u003cgroup\u003ekey=36\n\u003cregion\u003ehivel=31 sample=kick_vl1.wav\n\u003cregion\u003elovel=32 hivel=63 sample=kick_vl2.wav\n\u003cregion\u003elovel=64 hivel=95 sample=kick_vl3.wav\n\u003cregion\u003elovel=96 sample=kick_vl4.wav\n```\n\nHowever, the quiet samples will play quieter than they should - because of\nstandard velocity tracking, each sample would play at full volume if the\nvelocity was 127, but we actually need each sample to play at full volume at the\nvelocity which is equal to its hivel value. This can be done in various ways,\nand the way we recommend is the [amp_velcurve_N](/opcodes/amp_velcurve_N)\nopcode, like this:\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003eloop_mode=one_shot\n\n\u003cgroup\u003ekey=36\n\u003cregion\u003ehivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 sample=kick_vl1.wav\n\u003cregion\u003elovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 sample=kick_vl2.wav\n\u003cregion\u003elovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 sample=kick_vl3.wav\n\u003cregion\u003elovel=96 sample=kick_vl4.wav\n```\n\nLet's say that each dynamic layer also contains four round robins - four samples\nwith roughly the same dynamic. This allows us to include some variation, and\nsound more natural - fast parts won't sound like a \"machine gun\". There are two\nbasic ways to put round robins to use. One is to use the [seq_length](/opcodes/seq_length)\nand [seq_position](/opcodes/seq_position) opcodes, like this:\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003eloop_mode=one_shot\n\n\u003cgroup\u003ekey=36 hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 seq_length=4\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=1 sample=kick_vl1_rr1.wav\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=2 sample=kick_vl1_rr2.wav\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=3 sample=kick_vl1_rr3.wav\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=4 sample=kick_vl1_rr4.wav\n\u003cgroup\u003ekey=36 lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 seq_length=4\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=1 sample=kick_vl2_rr1.wav\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=2 sample=kick_vl2_rr2.wav\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=3 sample=kick_vl2_rr3.wav\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=4 sample=kick_vl2_rr4.wav\n\u003cgroup\u003ekey=36 lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 seq_length=4\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=1 sample=kick_vl3_rr1.wav\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=2 sample=kick_vl3_rr2.wav\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=3 sample=kick_vl3_rr3.wav\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=4 sample=kick_vl3_rr4.wav\n\u003cgroup\u003ekey=36 lovel=96 seq_length=4\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=1 sample=kick_vl4_rr1.wav\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=2 sample=kick_vl4_rr2.wav\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=3 sample=kick_vl4_rr3.wav\n\u003cregion\u003eseq_position=4 sample=kick_vl4_rr4.wav\n```\n\nThat's a kick drum with four dynamic layers and four sequential round robins.\nAs you might have noticed, we're repeating the key=36 and seq_length=4 opcodes\nin every group. Those two opcodes could be moved to the global level if all we\nwanted was a kick drum, but as we're going to have other instruments with other\nkeys and possibly different numbers of round robins, we kept them at the group\nlevel. The other way to use round robins is randomized, using the\n[lorand and hirand](/opcodes/lorand) opcodes.

Almost,\nbecause well-sampled hi-hats will have many different articulations, and that\ncreates some additional considerations, which we will describe on [another page](/tutorials/cymbal_muting).\n"},{"slug":["envelope_generators"],"title":"Envelope Generators","content":"Envelope generators (EGs) are used to control the profile of the volume, filter,\n pitch, or other parameter, based on the timing of the key press and release\n(including sustain/sostenudo pedal release.)  These are often called \"ADSRs\",\nafter the four parameters (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) that were used\nto control envelopes in early synthesizers (and many current ones as well.)\n\nSee [SFZ1 Modulations](tutorials/sfz1_modulations) to see examples of how these can be applied.\n\nSFZ has two types of EGs: SF1 and SF2.\n\n## SF1: DSAHDSR\n\nSF1 envelopes are sometimes called DSAHDSR after the 7 controls of the envelope,\nwhich are applied in the order given below.  An EG can control a variet of parameters,\nbut to help understand, you can imagine it controlling the volume, in which case you\ncan substitute \"volume\" for \"EG\" below.\n\n| Parameter             | Suffix | Description\n| ---                   | ---    | ---\n| Delay time (s)        | \\_delay   | time to wait after key is depressed until the EG starts\n| Start **level** (%)   | \\_start   | level at which to start\n| Attack time (s)       | \\_attack  | time from note start (at start level) to 100% level\n| Hold time (s)         | \\_hold    | time the volume is held at 100% level\n| Decay time* (s)       | \\_decay   | time* for the volume to decrease from 100% to the sustain level\n| Sustain **level** (%) | \\_sustain | the % level at which the EG remains while the key is down or the sustain pedal is down\n| Release time*         | \\_release | time* for the EG to decrease to zero. This begins when both key and sustain pedal are released, even if the prior stages have not completed.\n\nWe'll get to the asterisks in a moment.  Here is a screenshot of an audio file created using Sforzando,\nshowing the ampeg_envelope shape and its stages.  Note that this image assumes the Start level is 0.\nIf it were nonzero, the tip of the left-pointing arrow would look chopped off vertically.\n\n{%include img-fluid.liquid\n  img=\"/assets/img/ampeg_env.jpg\"\n  alt=\"DAHDSR envelope shape image\"%}\n\n\thttps://media.discordapp.net/attachments/573505647841116161/720408000828932196/EnvelopeGraphic.png\n\nHere's a play-by-play explanation, when using the EG for volume (ampeg_xxx).\nWhen the key is depressed, Delay time elapses and then the note starts (at Start level, which above is\nthe default of 0.)\nThe volume increases (at a constant dB/sec rate) for the Attack time and then reaches the peak level\nfor that note (which is controlled by the velocity and possibly other parameters.)\nThe volume stays at that level for the Hold time, after which it falls off for the Decay time\nuntil it reaches the Sustain level.  It remains at that level until the key and sustain pedal\nare both released, when it takes the Release time to fall off to silence.\n\nNow the asterisks.\n\n* Decay time is actually a constant decay **rate** that is specified as the time for the EG to go from 100% to **0%**.  However, this can be changed by setting xxx_decay_zero=0 to instead mean to decay from 100% to **sustain level** in the given time, from the actual sustain level.\n* Release time is actually a constant decay **rate** that is specified as the time for the EG to go from the **sustain level** to zero.  However, this can be changed setting by xxx_release_zero=1 to instead mean to decay from **100%** to zero in the given time.\n* When using an amp enevlope generator, \"0%\" means \"silence\" but it's actually interpreted as -90dBFS for Aria, or -80dBFS for original sfz.  This adjustment is needed because volume is contolled in dB, and silence in dB is negative infinity, which complicates the math.\n* Yeah, it's confusing.\n\nNote that when using an envelope generator to control volume, it is usually not necessary to adjust release or decay times based on velocity: that will happen naturally.  That is, if I configure ```ampeg_release=1``` and play a very loud note, that note will decay with a rate so that one second later it will be about 90 dB quieter than when it started.  If I play a very soft note, that note will also decay with the same rate, so that 1 second later it will be 90 dB quieter when it started.  That's pretty close to how most natural instruments behave.\n\nAnother note when using an envelope to control volume: if you're playing a sample that already has a natural envelope, such as the pluck of a harp string, you normally don't have to configure the envelope because it's already in the sample, which has a natural attack and decay.  However, you'll still probably want to configure a release, so that if the key is released before the sample is finished, it doesn't end abruptly.  With most natural instruments, this release rate varies with pitch, but not velocity.\n\n## SF2\n\nThe SF2 standard has a more flexible generator that can be used in addition to\nthe above.  This is briefly described in [SF2 Modulations:Envelopes](/tutorials/sfz2_modulations#envelopes).\n"},{"slug":["epic_drums"],"title":"Epic Drums","content":"\n## Basic Concept\n\nEpic percussion in media music is commonly created by recording large ensembles of large, low-tuned drums (for example taikos) in large, naturally reverberant spaces. The Virtuosity Drums kit includes an \"Epic\" knob which makes the small, high-tuned jazz kit recorded in a music store sound surprisingly, well, epic. This tutorial explains how that trick works.\n\nUsing drum samples at pitches lower than the original recording makes them sound bigger in several ways. One, obviously, the pitch is lower. Two, slowing down the playback\nalso slows down attack times and lengthens decay tails. This includes any reverb tails captured by the microphones, which means pitching a sound down makes it sound as if\nit was recorded in a larger space. However, pitching sounds down also takes away the high end and reduces definition.\n\nPlaying a sound at both its original pitch and tuned down an octave is a way to get both at the same time - a large, deep sound with reverb tails twice the length of the\nreal recording, and the clarity and definition of the originally pitched sample. This could be done using the [tune](/opcodes/tune) opcode, though [transpose](/opcodes/transpose) is likely more convenient. Here is a very simple example using a single floor tom sample:\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003e\nsample=Rack_Tom.wav\n\n\u003cregion\u003e\ntranspose=-12\nsample=Rack_Tom.wav\n```\n\nIf the sample maps are modularized using [#include](/opcodes/include) statements, it becomes very simple to set up a volume control, and also use [locc](/opcodes/hiccN) so that the transposed samples don't use up polyphony voices when their volume is at zero.\n\n```\n\u003cmaster\u003e\namplitude_oncc101=100\nlocc101=1\n#include \"sample_maps/rack_tom.sfz\"\n\n\u003cmaster\u003e\namplitude_oncc102=100\nlocc102=1\ntranspose=-12\n#include \"sample_maps/rack_tom.sfz\"\n```\n\n## Some Pitfalls\n\nThis does not work as well with close mics, which don't have much room reverb in the recording. This is why in Virtuosity Drums, the kick and snare mics aren't used with\nthe Epic control.  With kicks and other low drums, there's also a point of diminishing returns with having a lot of low frequencies, which is one more reason to not apply\nthis to kick close mics.\n\nAlthough sample maps can often be reused, as in the above example, instruments which have self-muting behavior, such as hi-hats, or instruments with polyphony limitations\nwill need separate polyphony [group](/opcodes/group) numbers for the transposed regions, just as if the transposed regions were separate microphone positions. With [complex muting scenarios](/tutorials/cymbal_muting) this will result in very large numbers of groups which can be difficult to keep track of, but with simple self-muting it could look like this:\n\n```\n\u003cmaster\u003e\namplitude_oncc101=100\nlocc101=1\ngroup=1\noff_by=1\n#include \"sample_maps/hi_hat.sfz\"\n\n\u003cmaster\u003e\namplitude_oncc102=100\nlocc102=1\ngroup=11\noff_by=11\ntranspose=-12\n#include \"sample_maps/hi_hat.sfz\"\n```\n\nIf the samples include any preroll before the hit, which more distant microphone samples naturally will, transposing down an octave will double the length of that preroll.\nThis is usually not a problem, but in extreme cases it may be necessary to use [offset](/opcodes/offset) to reduce the preroll to avoid a flam sound. In Virtuosity Drums, this is done for the hi-hat pedal articulations.\n\nOn the topic of flams, this does not work well with flams, buzz rolls and other sounds which do not consist of a single distinct hit. Long rolls and partially\nclosed hi-hats seem to work fairly well, however. Tambourines, shakers etc. will usually sound quite unnatural with the transposed and untransposed sound appearing as separate entities, but sometimes this can be musically useful.\n\n## Other Uses\n\nApplying this trick to a snare bottom mic usually results in a sound which is not epic, but can be very industrial.\n\nBeyond drums, this could work reasonably well with other instruments. Sounds with fast, distinct attacks will behave more similarly to drums, though at least on principle this could be used with sounds such as sustained bowed strings also. Of course, pitched instruments can be doubled with another note an octave lower without transposition, as long as the lower note also falls in their range. However, transposition an octave down does make the reverb tails twice as long.\n"},{"slug":["legato"],"title":"Legato","content":"\n## Basic monophony\n\nIn the basic sustained instruments\ntutorial, we have the below example of a monophonic flute, which uses the\n[group](/opcodes/group) and [off_by](/opcodes/off_by) opcodes to allow only one be played at a time, and the [off_mode](/opcodes/off_mode)\ntogether with [ampeg_release](/opcodes/ampeg_release) make the fadeout of the previous note a little\nsmoother. This is a starting point for implementing legato.\n\nIf only group and off_by are specified, the resulting sound will probably be quite bad, as\nthis will use default values for off_mode, ampeg_attack and ampeg_release. This means the note being\nmuted will drop off extremely quickly, which will probably leave an audible drop in levels during the\ntransition, unless the next note has an extremely fast attack.

In many cases, though, it makes sense to treat the legato notes\ndifferently than the notes which start a phrase when no other note is playing. The\n[trigger](/opcodes/trigger) opcode is used to separate regions into initial and legato. For\nsustained sounds, it can make sense to use the [offset](/opcodes/offset) opcode to skip the start\nof the sample for legato regions. It's also probably a good idea to use offset_attack\nin these cases, which both makes the transition sound smoother and avoids clicks and\npops in cases where the offset does not fall on a zero crossing. Here are the relevant\nopcodes from the Hadziha choir.\n\nAn offset of 6000 samples is enough to skip the fraction of a second when the singers\nare starting the note, but not enough to skip the part of the sample when they're still\nsettling on a common pitch, so it works well for this particular choir. The crossfade\ntimes with an off time of 1 second and legato note attack time of 0.4 seconds are\nprobably much longer than would be needed for most solo instruments or voices, or\nensembles intended for fast legato, but could be a good range for other types of\nensembles playing slowly.\n\nNote that the samples are not all in the same group - the initial note regions are in\npolyphony group 1, which is muted by group 2. The legato regions are in polyphony\ngroup 2, which mutes itself. Having everything in group 1 should also work, though.\nThis was done this was to allow the use of additional syllable start samples, which\nwould then be group 3 and also be muted by group 2. As with hi-hat muting, if there\nare multiple mic positions in separate files, each mic position will need its own\npolyphony groups.\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003eoff_mode=time\noff_time=1\namp_veltrack=0\n\n\u003cmaster\u003etrigger=first\ngroup=1\noff_by=2\n//Sample map goes here\n#include \"mappings/6_a_map.sfz\"\n\n\u003cmaster\u003etrigger=legato\noffset=6000\nampeg_attack=0.4\ngroup=2\noff_by=2\n//Sample map goes here\n#include \"mappings/6_a_map.sfz\"\n```\n\nAs this does not use velocity to control note volume, that frees up velocity for\nsomething else, so in this specific case velocity is repurposed to shorten the\nattack time on the legato notes, which makes the patch more intuitively playable.\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003eoff_mode=time\noff_time=1\namp_veltrack=0\n\n\u003cmaster\u003etrigger=first\ngroup=1\noff_by=3\n//Sample map goes here\n#include \"mappings/6_a_map.sfz\"\n\n\u003cmaster\u003etrigger=legato\noffset=6000\nampeg_attack=1\nampeg_vel2attack=-0.8\ngroup=3\noff_by=3\n//Sample map goes here\n#include \"mappings/6_a_map.sfz\"\n```\n\n## Portamento\n\nAnother possibility is portamento, or having a pitch glide implemented on the\nlegato regions. Here are the relevant opcodes from Karoryfer Samples\nMeatbass, which has both legato and portamento. The portamento is\nvery obviously fake for slow glides across long intervals, but as long as the\ninterval is no more than a third or fourth, it can be convincing. Of course, the\nnarrower the interval and the shorter the time, the easier it is to sound\nconvincing. With the portamento time at zero, this is effectively the same as\nnon-portamento legato in the above example.\n\nIn the below setup, MIDI CC109 controls the glide time and an SFZ2 [envelope](/modulations/envelope_generators)\nis used to make the pitch change happen. CC140 is the ARIA extension CC for pitch\ndelta, and being the difference in pitch between the previous note and the\ncurrent note, it sets the depth of the glide envelope.\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003eeg06_sustain=1 //Pitch envelope setup for legato slides\neg06_level0=-1 //Envelope starts away from the note pitch\neg06_time0=0\neg06_pitch_oncc140=100 //This is the pitch depth\neg06_time1=0\neg06_level1=0 //At the end of the envelope, return to base pitch\n//eg06_time1_oncc109 needs to be set for the legato regions - but we don't want\n//it on for all regions so the default is 0\n//At zero envelope duration the pitch goes to base pitch immediately so there\n//is no glide\n\n//Typical stuff for monophonic instruments\noff_mode=normal\nampeg_release_oncc104=2\n```\n\nAll the sample regions are then basically duplicated in non-legato and legato\nversions. Here's an example non-legato region with trigger\nset to first and no eg06_time_oncc109 set. The group and off_by work just like\nin the above examples.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\ntrigger=first\noff_mode=normal\ngroup=1\noff_by=1\n\n\u003cregion\u003e\nsample=..\\Samples\\arco_looped\\c4_sustain.wav\npitch_keycenter=48\n```\n\nAnd the corresponding legato region with trigger set to legato, the eg06 glide\nenvelope time control, and also an attack time, to let the note fade in\nmore gradually, with this controlled by CC100 rather than velocity, as the\nexample above. This is another option.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\ntrigger=legato\noff_mode=normal\ngroup=1\noff_by=1\neg06_time1_oncc109=0.3\nampeg_attack_oncc100=0.5\n\n\n\u003cregion\u003e\nsample=..\\Samples\\arco_looped\\c4_sustain.wav\npitch_keycenter=48\n```\n\n## True sampled legato\n\nHere are examples from a simple flute test by MatFluor. The trigger=first regions\nwork similarly as all the above examples, and the [sw_previous](/opcodes/sw_previous) opcode can be used\nto choose which sample plays for the legato regions. If the samples would include\nboth the legato transition and the complete sustain of the following note, things\nwould be very simple:\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\n// Legato transitions and the complete sustain of the next note both in the same sample\ntrigger=legato\ngroup=2\noff_by=1\nampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_release=0.2\noff_mode=normal\n\n// Leg transitions up\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=legatovib_g4_a4.wav key=A4 sw_previous=G4\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=legatovib_g4_c5.wav key=C5 sw_previous=G4\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=legatovib_a4_c5.wav key=C5 sw_previous=A4\n// Leg transitions down\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=legatovib_c5_a4.wav key=A4 sw_previous=C5\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=legatovib_c5_g4.wav key=G4 sw_previous=C5\n```\n\nRecording the full sustain after every transition adds greatly to the recording\ntime, diskspace and RAM use, however. It may be necessary in some cases, such as\nsolo vocals, but in other cases it's possible to use transition samples which\nare short, then fade in the regular sustain sample.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\n// Legato transitions in one sample, crossfaded into standard sustain in another sample\ntrigger=legato\ngroup=2\noff_by=1\nampeg_attack=0.05 ampeg_release=0.2\noff_mode=normal\n\n// Leg transitions up\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=legatovib_g4_a4.wav key=A4 sw_previous=G4 ampeg_hold=0.25 ampeg_decay=0.2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=45000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=legatovib_g4_c5.wav key=C5 sw_previous=G4 ampeg_hold=0.25 ampeg_decay=0.2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=45000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=legatovib_a4_c5.wav key=C5 sw_previous=A4 ampeg_hold=0.25 ampeg_decay=0.2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=45000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4\n// Leg transitions down\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=legatovib_c5_a4.wav key=A4 sw_previous=C5 ampeg_hold=0.25 ampeg_decay=0.2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=45000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=legatovib_c5_g4.wav key=G4 sw_previous=C5 ampeg_hold=0.25 ampeg_decay=0.2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=45000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=legatovib_a4_g4.wav key=G4 sw_previous=A4 ampeg_hold=0.25 ampeg_decay=0.2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=43000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1.4\n// Leg sustains\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=sustainvib_c5.wav key=C5 ampeg_attack=0.3 offset=5000 ampeg_attack_shape=3.8\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=sustainvib_a4.wav key=A4 ampeg_attack=0.3 offset=5000 ampeg_attack_shape=3.8\n\u003cregion\u003e sample=sustainvib_g4.wav key=G4 ampeg_attack=0.3 offset=5000 ampeg_attack_shape=3.8\n```\n\nAnother consideration is that for instruments with a wide range, it may not be worthwhile\nto record every possible transition, and only record transitions of up to one octave, for\nexample.

Regardless of which file folder the included\nfiles are in, the sample file paths and include file paths will be calculated starting with the folder which contains\nthe instrument file.\n\nSo, if our above example instrument has the main SFZ file, called main.sfz, in a Programs folder under the instrument\nroot, samples in a Samples folder under that, and the sample_map.sfz is in Programs/mappings, then main.sfz should contain:\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nhicc100=63\n#include \"mappings/sample_map.sfz\"\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nlocc100=64\ngroup=1\noff_by=1\n#include \"mappings/sample_map.sfz\"\n```\n\nThe sample_map.sfz file in mappings should have the following contents:\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=48 sample=../Samples/c4.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=49 sample=../Samples/db4.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=50 sample=../Samples/d4.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=51 sample=../Samples/eb4.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=52 sample=../Samples/e4.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=53 sample=../Samples/f4.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=54 sample=../Samples/gb4.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=55 sample=../Samples/g4.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=56 sample=../Samples/ab4.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=57 sample=../Samples/a4.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=58 sample=../Samples/bb4.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=59 sample=../Samples/b4.wav\n\u003cregion\u003ekey=60 sample=../Samples/c5.wav\n```\n\nThis means that opening the main.sfz file will work, but trying to open sample_map.sfz directly would not, as it would\ntry to locate the samples in a relative path of ../Samples, which exists when starting from Programs, but does not exist\nwhen starting from Programs/modules. This can make testing sample maps somewhat messy, as they need to be moved out of\ntheir \"proper\" folder if the map needs to be tested by itself, without the rest of the SFZ.\n\n## Include And Nesting\n\nIncluded files can, themselves, include files. This is not a problem, just avoid circular recursion.\n\n## Other Use Cases For Include\n\nIn addition to sample maps, modulations can also be reused. For example, a common set of vibrato controls can be included\nfor violin samples which need them, but left out for samples which don't, such as harmonics, percussive noises and legato\ntransitions. Different dynamics controls for long vs. short bowed articulations are also candidates for such treatment.\n\n```\n\u003cmaster\u003e\nsw_last=34\nsw_label=Sustain\n#include \"modules/vibrato.sfz\"\n#include \"modules/long_dynamics.sfz\"\n#include \"mappings/sustain.sfz\"\n\n\u003cmaster\u003e\nsw_last=33\nsw_label=Staccato\n#include \"modules/vibrato.sfz\"\n#include \"modules/short_dynamics.sfz\"\n#include \"mappings/staccato.sfz\"\n\n\u003cmaster\u003e\nsw_last=32\nsw_label=Natural harmonics\n#include \"modules/long_dynamics.sfz\"\n#include \"mappings/harmonics.sfz\"\n\n\u003cmaster\u003e\nsw_last=31\nsw_label=Percussive noises\n#include \"modules/short_dynamics.sfz\"\n#include \"mappings/noises.sfz\"\n```\n\nThe same file can also be included in multiple instruments, for example a violin spiccato articulation map can\nbe used in both a spiccato-only instrument and in a keyswitch instrument which contains other articulations as\nwell.\n\nPutting each set of round robins inside its own file without defining [seq_position](/opcodes/seq_position) inside that\nfile can also be useful for emulating double-tracking. If the basic non-doubletracked instrument is set up like this:\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003e\nseq_length=4\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nseq_position=1\n#include \"mappings/palm_mute_rr1_map.sfz\"\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nseq_position=2\n#include \"mappings/palm_mute_rr2_map.sfz\"\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nseq_position=3\n#include \"mappings/palm_mute_rr3_map.sfz\"\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nseq_position=4\n#include \"mappings/palm_mute_rr4_map.sfz\"\n```\n\nIt then becomes very simple to make a doubletracked instrument which uses differnt round robins in the left and right channels:\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003e\nseq_length=4\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\npan=100\nseq_position=1\n#include \"mappings/palm_mute_rr1_map.sfz\"\n\u003cgroup\u003e\npan=100\nseq_position=2\n#include \"mappings/palm_mute_rr2_map.sfz\"\n\u003cgroup\u003e\npan=100\nseq_position=3\n#include \"mappings/palm_mute_rr3_map.sfz\"\n\u003cgroup\u003e\npan=100\nseq_position=4\n#include \"mappings/palm_mute_rr4_map.sfz\"\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\npan=-100\nseq_position=1\n#include \"mappings/palm_mute_rr2_map.sfz\"\n\u003cgroup\u003e\npan=-100\nseq_position=2\n#include \"mappings/palm_mute_rr3_map.sfz\"\n\u003cgroup\u003e\npan=-100\nseq_position=3\n#include \"mappings/palm_mute_rr4_map.sfz\"\n\u003cgroup\u003e\npan=-100\nseq_position=4\n#include \"mappings/palm_mute_rr1_map.sfz\"\n```\n\n## Include And Headers\n\nWhen including files, it's common to put lower levels of [header](/headers) organization, such as region and group in the\nincluded file,  and put higher levels in the main file. However, this is not necessary, and any levels of headers can be\nincluded. It is important to keep in mind that included files are essentially just concatenated to make the SFZ file which\nthe SFZ instrument actually parses. Although an included file is a little like a procedure in a programming language, it\nisn't really one, and the end of the included file is not meaningful when \n\nSFZ opcodes set under headers within an included file will be in effect until encountering another header of the same or\nhigher level. For example, let's say a snare drum sample map contains one-shot samples under `\u003cregion\u003e` headers and also\nmultisampled hits under a `\u003cgroup\u003e` header later in the file, and this file is called snare_map.sfz.\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=37\nsample=Sidestick.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=39\nsample=Off_center.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nkey=40\nsample=Rimshot.wav\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nkey=38\nseq_length=4\n\u003cregion\u003e\nseq_position=1\nsample=Center_rr1.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nseq_position=2\nsample=Center_rr2.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nseq_position=3\nsample=Center_rr3.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e\nseq_position=4\nsample=Center_rr4.wav\n```\n\nIf we want to put snare controls which apply to all those, this would work:\n\n```\n\u003cmaster\u003e\namplitude_oncc100=100\ntune_oncc101=1200\ntune_curvecc101=1\n#include \"snare_map.sfz\"\n```\n\nThis, however, would make the controls affect the sidesticks, off-center hits and rimshot, but not the center hits:\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\namplitude_oncc100=100\ntune_oncc101=1200\ntune_curvecc101=1\n#include \"snare_map.sfz\"\n```\n\nThat is because the opcodes set under the `\u003cgroup\u003e` header would only be active until the `\u003cgroup\u003e` header for the center\nhits is reached. If a `\u003cmaster\u003e` header is used, they remain in force until another `\u003cmaster\u003e` header is encountered. When\nthe headers are not immediately visible because they're in an included file, it is easy to fall into this kind of trap.\n\n## The Define Statement\n\nIn addition to include, [#define](/opcodes/define) is the other statement which is very useful in making instruments more modular.\n\nDefine and include can be used together. For example, user-editable parameters, such as MIDI note assignments for drum kits\nand CC ranges, can also be placed in a separate file such as the below.\n\t\n```\n#define $KICKKEY 36\n#define $SIDESTICKKEY 37\n#define $SNAREKEY 38\n```\n\nThe defined variables can then be used throughout the instrument, and an end user who wants to change the keymap can edit the\nfile containing the defined numbers without having to search through the entire instrument. In the specific implementation of ARIA,\nanything which uses the defined variables also needs to be placed in the main SFZ file using include, because of the way ARIA\nparses SFZ files, described in more detail under the opcode page.\n\nUsing define as a constant with a single value thorughout an instrument works easily. Defining the same variable to have multiple\nvalues at different points in the same instrument, however, requires care. Using #define to set the same variable to different\nvalues at one point in the same SFZ file does not work well at least in ARIA/Sforzando when loading an instrument. However, a\nworkaround there is to use include to put each set of define statements with different values in a separate file. In simple\ntests, that has been successful.\n\nSometimes copying large chunks of SFZ code and performing search-replace within them is easier than redefining variables comes into\nplay. There's a balance of when to use include statements and when to just copy some files and use search-replace.\n\nMultiple defined variables can be used in the same line.\n\n```\n#define $MIC_NAME Room\n#define $MIC_MIX_CC 32\n\u003ccontrol\u003e\nlabel_cc$MIC_MIX_CC=$MIC_NAME\n```\nOne thing to keep in mind is that each variable name should be unique. This is good:\n\n```\n#define $SNARE_KEY 38\n#define $SNARE_RIMSHOT_KEY 40\n```\n\nThis will fail in at least some SFZ players, because the complete name of one variable is also the start of another variable's name:\n\n```\n#define $SNARE 38\n#define $SNARE_RIMSHOT 40\n"},{"slug":["range_extension"],"title":"Range extension","content":"\nThis tutorial describes how to extend the range of an instrument which does not\nhave samples for all notes in the desired range. This is not complicated, but\nthere are some downsides to doing it the simple way. Things work the same way\nwhen extending up or down. When there are intermediate pitches missing, for\nexample when an instrument is sampled every minor third or every octave, there\nwon't be much choice, though if round robins are available the last approach\ncan prove useful.\n\n## Simple extension of closest avaialble sample\n\nLet's say we have only one sampled violin section with the following map, and\nwe want to be able to play the notes for another octave above the highest\ncurrently avaialble note.\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4.wav key=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=db4.wav key=49\n\u003cregion\u003esample=d4.wav key=50\n\u003cregion\u003esample=eb4.wav key=51\n\u003cregion\u003esample=e4.wav key=52\n\u003cregion\u003esample=f4.wav key=53\n\u003cregion\u003esample=gb4.wav key=54\n\u003cregion\u003esample=g4.wav key=55\n\u003cregion\u003esample=ab4.wav key=56\n\u003cregion\u003esample=a4.wav key=57\n\u003cregion\u003esample=bb4.wav key=58\n\u003cregion\u003esample=b4.wav key=59\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c5.wav key=60\n```\n\nThe simplest way is to just stretch the highest note. Using\nlokey, hikey and pitch_keycenter as separate opcodes is \nbetter than using key and transpose, as it allows one region\nto cover a wide range of pitches.\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c5.wav lokey=60 hikey=72 pitch_keycenter=60\n```\n\nNote that ARIA will produce no sound if asked to transpose\na sample more than four octaves up - if that is needed,\ncreate some extra copies of the samples and transpose them\nin an audio editor. This accounts for transposition, pitch\nbend and any other tuning adjustments, so if an octave of\npitch bend is needed, the maximum effectively avaialable\ntranspotition becomes an octave less. There is no similar\nlimitation with downward transposition, though.\n\n## Filling in missing pitches\n\nIn the above case, the range is being stretched upwards, but\nthe same principle applies if there are notes missing within\nthe range, whether due to recording errors, or the limitations\nof instruments which can't produce all notes of the chromatic\nscale.\n\nLet's say we have a simple pentatonic xylophone.\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4.wav key=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=d4.wav key=50\n\u003cregion\u003esample=f4.wav key=53\n\u003cregion\u003esample=g4.wav key=55\n\u003cregion\u003esample=a4.wav key=57\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c5.wav key=60\n\u003cregion\u003esample=d5.wav key=62\n\u003cregion\u003esample=f5.wav key=65\n\u003cregion\u003esample=g5.wav key=67\n\u003cregion\u003esample=a5.wav key=69\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c6.wav key=72\n```\n\nThis would work similar as above, covering every\npitch with the nearest available note. Whether\nto stretch up or down when there are two equally\ndistant notes available is a judgment call.

Of course this could be more\nwork than just recording the target pitches in the first place,\nbut if the pitches are difficult to produce consistently (for \nexample are notes that a singer can hit only with considerable\nstrain) or just physically fall outside the range, it may be a\nviable option.\n\n## True legato samples.\n\nExtending the range with true legato samples requires extending the range\nfor both the previous note (the sw_previous values) and the new note\n(the lokey/hikey values). Here is a process which has worked in practice\nfor extending the range of a legato instrument upwards by a major second:\n\n* Copy regions with the key to be extended. Add the amount of shift (3 if taking the second-highest and third-lowest note and extending the range by a major second) to sw_previous, lokey and hikey to the copy.\n* Copy regions with the sw_previous to be extended except those already copied in the previous step. Likewise add the amount of shift to sw_previous, lokey and hikey to the copy.\n* Delete the regions with sw_previous above the new max range (or could try avoiding copying them in the first step, but this way is probably safer).\n* Add in regions going from the bottom three values of sw_previous to the new notes. This is where some sort of defaults, as mentioned above, will be needed.\n* Add regions going from the new extended notes to the bottom three pitches, as above.\n\nNote that there will be no legato samples covering the widest intervals\nfrom the extended notes to the farthest notes on the other side. If the\ninstrument has legato samples only recorded within a certain range (for\nexample only for intervals up to an octave), this isn't going to create\nany additional problems that didn't already have to be solved when making\nthe non-extended legato instruments - so whether defaulting to the\nlargest interval sampled, triggering a regular sustain or just producing\nno sound at all, just do the same when there's no interval wide enough\nfor a leap to or from an extended note. If an instrument does have every\npossible note transition in its range sampled, however (quite possible\nfor instruments with a small range, such as rebab), the same\ncompromises are available for the missing intervals in the extended range.\n"},{"slug":["sfz1_modulations"],"title":"SFZ1 modulations","content":"The set of [modulations] available under the SFZ1 specification is fixed, and\nthere's a dedicated opcode for every possible modulation, including fairly\nesoteric ones such as using note velocity to modulate the hold stage of the\npitch envelope.\n\n## Basic MIDI CC modulation\n\nA few opcodes can be modulated simply by MIDI CC, with the modulation adding\nto what the opcode would normally do. These are: [offset](/opcodes/offset) and\n[delay](/opcodes/delay).\n\nFor example, this would have a sample offset of 500 when the modulating CC is\nat 0, and a sample offset of 1000 when the modulating CC is at max:\n\n```\noffset=500\noffset_cc100=500\n```\n\nIt's also possible to just specify the modulation, in which case the\ndefault value is what will be modulated. The defaults for offset, delay and\nEQ band gain are 0, so this would result in the offset being modulated between\n0 and 1000:\n\n```\noffset_cc100=1000\n```\n\n## Modulating default values\n\nThe three EQ bands' [frequency](/opcodes/eqN_freq), [bandwidth](/opcodes/eqN_bw) and\n[gain](/opcodes/eqN_gain) work similarly, but also add velocity tracking. The EQ\nbandwidth and center frequency also have non-zero defaults,\nfor example eq2_freq is 500 if not specified. So, this would modulate the center\nfrequency of the second EQ band between 500 and 1500 if eq2_freq is left at default:\n\n```\neq2_freqcc110=1000\n```\n\n## Velocity tracking, keytracking and randomization\n\nEQ [frequency](/opcodes/eqN_vel2freq) and [gain](/opcodes/eqN_vel2gain) (but not\nbandwidth) can additionally be modulated by velocity. For example, if we want to\nmake a sound brighter when the velocity is higher, we might use something like this:\n\n```\neq1_vel2gain=-6\neq2_vel2gain=12\neq2_vel2freq=500\n```\n\nThe [xfin](/opcodes/xfin_loccN)/[xfout](/opcodes/xfout_loccN) CCs are also a\nway to fade sounds in and out using MIDI CC. An example of one note with two\ndynamic layers being crossfaded:\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003esample=e4_ft_p.wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127\n\u003cregion\u003esample=e4_ft_f.wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127\n```\n\nIn addition to MIDI CC, crossfades can also use MIDI note number and velocity as\nmodulation sources, and the [xf_cccurve](/opcodes/xf_cccurve), [xf_keycurve](/opcodes/xf_keycurve)\nand [xf_velcurve](/opcodes/xf_velcurve) give the choice of two curves for each of these modulations.\n\nMore sophisticated modulations are possible with volume,\npitch and [filter cutoff](/opcodes/cutoff). Volume and cutoff can be modulated by MIDI CC directly\n(pitch can't in SFZ1 - the tune_ccN modulation is an ARIA extension). All three\ncan also have randomization applied and be modulated by MIDI note number and\nvelocity. The nomenclature for volume is a little confusing, with [gain_ccN](/opcodes/volume) using\n\"gain\" in the name, while the others are called [amp_random](/opcodes/amp_random),\n[amp_keytrack](/opcodes/amp_keytrack) and [amp_veltrack](/opcodes/amp_veltrack).\n\n```\ngain_cc80=-6\namp_random=3\namp_keytrack=-1.3\namp_veltrack=80\n```\n\n## LFOs and envelopes\n\nVolume, filter and cutoff also each get an [LFO](/modulations/lfo#sfz-1-lfos) and an\n[envelope](/modulations/envelope_generators#sfz-1-egs). The LFO rate and\ndepth can be modulated by MIDI CC. Each LFO also has a simple envelope with\ndelay and fade, but modulating the duration of these is not allowed under the\nSFZ1 spec (though it is with SFZ2 LFOs). Here's a typical pitch vibrato LFO:\n\n```\npitchlfo_freq=2\npitchlfo_freqcc50=10\npitchlfo_depthcc51=33\n```\n\nEach envelope parameter can also be modulated by CC, or by velocity. Here's a\nexmple setup for a synth-style ADSR volume envelope (hold is not specified so the\ndefault hold value of 0 is used) controlled by CCs and some initial\nminimum values set for attack and release, along with a default sustain of 0:\n\n```\nampeg_attack=0.001\nampeg_attack_oncc40=1\nampeg_decay_oncc41=4\nampeg_sustain=1\nampeg_sustain_oncc42=100\nampeg_release=0.1\nampeg_release_oncc43=0.9\n```\n\nModulating envelope parameters with velocity allows, for example, setting up a filter\non an acid bass which will sweep farther with higher velocity, and also sweep faster.\n\n```\ncutoff=120\nresonance=12\nfileg_attack=0.5\nfileg_decay=1\nfileg_depth=500\nfileg_vel2attack=-0.4\nfileg_vel2decay=-0.8\nfileg_vel2depth=4000\n```\n\nIf something is not described above, then modulating it is not possible under the\nSFZ1 specification, and will require [using SFZ2](/tutorials/sfz2_modulations)\nor possibly some extension opcodes.\n\n\n[modulations]: /modulations/index\n"},{"slug":["sfz2_modulations"],"title":"SFZ2 modulations","content":"The [modulations] available under SFZ2 are much more flexible than the fixed set\n[specified by SFZ1](/tutorials/sfz1_modulations). All SFZ1 modulations are still\navailable under the SFZ2 spec, and will often be easier to use in cases such as\nenvelopes where the standard AHDSR shape is all that's needed.\n\nThe basic difference is that SFZ1 has three envelopes - one assigned to\nvolume, one to pitch, and one to filter cutoff. There are also three LFOs,\none for each of those modulation targets. SFZ2 can have an arbitraty number\nof envelopes and LFOs, with the ability to specify one or more modulation\ntargets from a list. It is even possible for LFOs to modulate other LFOs\nand envelopes to modulate LFOs (but not for LFOs to modulate envelopes).\nIn addition, SFZ2 envelopes can have an arbitrary number of points.\n\n## Additional MIDI CC modulation\n\nSFZ2 adds one more paramter which can be modulated with MIDI CC - [stereo width](/opcodes/width_onccN).\nAlso need to document pan_onccX and find out whether it's SFZ1 or SFZ2 - currently\nnot sure, needs testing.\n\n## LFOs\n\nFor each LFO, an LFO number must be specified - lfo01, lfo02 etc. Each\nLFO has the following parameters:\n\n- [lfoN_wave](/opcodes/lfoN_wave)\n- [lfoN_freq](/opcodes/lfoN_freq)\n- [lfoN_freq_onccX](/opcodes/lfoN_freq)\n- [lfoN_freq_smoothccX](/opcodes/lfoN_freq_smoothccX)\n- [lfoN_freq_stepccX](/opcodes/lfoN_freq_stepccX)\n- [lfoN_delay](/opcodes/lfoN_delay)\n- [lfoN_delay_onccX](/opcodes/lfoN_delay)\n- [lfoN_fade](/opcodes/lfoN_fade)\n- [lfoN_fade_onccX](/opcodes/lfoN_fade)\n- [lfoN_phase](/opcodes/lfoN_phase)\n- [lfoN_phase_onccX](/opcodes/lfoN_phase)\n- [lfoN_count](/opcodes/lfoN_count)\n\nClick on each link for a detailed description. Similarly to SFZ1 LFOs,\nthere's a frequency, a delay and a fade-in time. In addition, the\nwaveform shape and initial phase can be specified and the LFO can\nbe configured to run for a limited number of counts.\n\nThe frequency, delay, fade and initial phase can all be modulated by\nMIDI CC. There is no modulation for LFO depth - to control the depth\nof vibrato etc, use MIDI CC to modulate how much the LFO affects the\ndesired target.\n\n## Available LFO targets\n\nThe available modulation targets for LFOs are These destinations are\nadded as a suffix to 'lfoN_'.

The opcodes used\nto create these envelopes are:\n\n- [egN_points](/opcodes/egN_points)\n- [egN_levelX](/opcodes/egN_levelX)\n- [egN_levelX_onccY](/opcodes/egN_levelX)\n- [egN_timeX](/opcodes/egN_timeX)\n- [egN_timeX_onccY](/opcodes/egN_timeX)\n- [egN_shapeX](/opcodes/egN_shapeX)\n- [egN_curveX](/opcodes/egN_curveX)\n- [egN_sustain](/opcodes/egN_sustain)\n- [egN_loop](/opcodes/egN_loop)\n\n## Envelope targets\n\nSimilarly to LFOs, envelopes have assignable modulation targets. These\ndestinations are added as a suffix to ‘egN_’  - so, for example:\n\n```\neg01_pitch=2400\n```\n\nwould have envelope 01 modulate pitch, with an envelope depth of 2400 cents.\n\nThese are the available targets related to amplitude and stereo positioning:\n\n- amplitude\n- amplitude_oncc\n- volume\n- volume_oncc\n- pan\n- pan_oncc\n- width\n- width_oncc\n\nTargets for pitch:\n\n- pitch\n- pitch_oncc\n\nTargets for filters:\n\n- cutoff\n- cutoff_oncc\n- resonance\n- resonance_oncc\n- cutoff2\n- cutoff2_oncc\n- resonance2\n- resonance2_oncc\n\nTargets for EQ bands:\n\n- eqNbw\n- eqNbw_oncc\n- eqNfreq\n- eqNfreq_oncc\n- eqNgain\n- eqNgain_oncc\n\nTargets for modulating LFOs:\n\n- depth_lfo\n- depthadd_lfo\n- freq_lfo\n\nThese two need to be tested - are they for envelopes to modulate other envelopes?\n\n- depth\n- depth_oncc\n\nTargets for modulating decim and bitred do not appear to have been included in the specification.\n\n## Example envelope\n\nHere is a simple pitch envelope which will start a note with a glide from up to an octave\nlower, with the depth and time modulated by MIDI CCs. The envelope will statt at a lower\nvalue at envelope point 0, and return the pitch to normal at envelope point 1.\n\n```\neg01_sustain=1 //Pitch envelope setup for slides\neg01_level0=1\neg01_level1=0\neg01_time0=0\neg01_time1=0\neg01_pitch_oncc100=-1200\neg01_time1_oncc101=1\n```\n\n## Using LFOs and envelopes together\n\nHere is an example of using both an envelope and an LFO to modulate pitch, with common\ndepth and delay parameters. The goal here is asymmetrical pitch vibrato - vibrato which\ndoes not go up and down around the original pitch, but instead only goes below it. This\nis idiomatic with saxophones, and is also how vibrato with certain types of non-floating\nguitar bridges works (string-bending vibrato is similar, of course, but in the other\ndirection).\n\nShifting the phase of LFO01 will make the vibrato waveform start at the top. We also need\nto lower the pitch by the same amount as the vibrato depth. Using an envelope for this\nallows us to delay the onset of the vibrato (again, an important element of idiomatic\nsaxophone vibrato) without a discontinuous jump in pitch.\n\n```\nlfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Saxy vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitch\nlfo01_freq=2\nlfo01_freq_oncc112=8\nlfo01_phase=0.25 //To make it start at the top\nlfo01_delay_oncc116=1\neg01_pitch_oncc111=20\neg01_sustain=1\neg01_level0=0\neg01_level1=0\neg01_level2=-1\neg01_time0=0\neg01_time1=0\neg01_time1_oncc116=1\neg01_time2=0\n```\n\n## Using SFZ1 and SFZ2 modulations together\n\nBoth SFZ1 and SFZ2 modulations may be mixed freely. Indeed, it may be simpler to accomplish\nthe above using the SFZ1 pitch envelope, as it is sufficient in this case, with the SFZ2\nLFO. Setting the initial phase and modulating the delay with MIDI CC would not be possible\nwith the SFZ1 pitch LFO.\n\n```\nlfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Saxy vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitch\nlfo01_freq=2\nlfo01_freq_oncc112=8\nlfo01_phase=0.25 //To make it start at the top\nlfo01_delay_oncc116=1\npitcheg_delay_oncc116=1 //Pitch envelope to drop the central pitch when sax vibrato kicks in\npitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20\n```\n\n## SmoothccN and stepccN\n\nMost MIDI CC modulations, though not all, can have use [smoothccN](/modulations/smoothccN) and [stepccN](/modulations/stepccN).\nThese work similarly to [bend_smooth](/opcodes/bend_smooth) and [bend_step](/opcodes/bend_step).\n\nSmoothccN adds \"inertia\" to a modulation, so quickly changing the MIDI CC value has a slower effect\non the modulation target than it would normally. StepccN causes the modulation to happen in a\ndiscrete number of steps. Setting the number of steps to 1 would make the modulation an\nall-or-nothing control.\n\nThis is what's possible under the SFZ2 specification. There are some additional modulations\navailable as [ARIA extensions](/opcodes/?v=aria), with [amplitude_onccN](/opcodes/amplitude)\nbeing a very useful one.\n\n\n[modulations]: /modulations/index\n"},{"slug":["subtractive_synths"],"title":"Subtractive synthesizers","content":"\n## Introduction\n\nThis tutorial describes implementing typical subtractive synthesizer\nmodulations - filters, envelopes and LFOs - in SFZ. It uses the\nCaveman Cosmonaut instrument by Karoryfer Samples as an example. This\ndoes not cover all modulations used in classic hardware subtractive\nsynths, but it's a start.\n\n## Basic amplifier envelope\n\nThough subtractive synths get their name from having frequencies\nsubtracted from the sound by filter, the volume envelope is probably\nthe most fundamental modulation. Here is an [AHDSR envelope](/opcodes/ampeg_attack) including\n[control](/headers/control) parameter labels and defaults.\n\n```\n\u003ccontrol\u003e\nlabel_cc100=Attack time\nlabel_cc101=Hold time\nlabel_cc102=Decay time\nlabel_cc103=Sustain level\nlabel_cc104=Release time\n\nset_cc102=63\nset_cc103=51\nset_cc104=31\n\n\u003cglobal\u003e\n//AHDSR\nampeg_attack=0.002\nampeg_sustain=0\nampeg_release=0.002\nampeg_attack_oncc100=0.5\nampeg_hold_oncc101=1\nampeg_decay_oncc102=5\nampeg_sustain_oncc103=100\nampeg_release_oncc104=2\n```\n\nAn ADSR envelope would simple leave out the [hold](/opcodes/ampeg_hold) stage control,\nleaving the default hold time of zero.\n\n## Further envelope possibilities\n\nThe above envelope will affect all sounds, as it's set at the global\nlevel. In many classic synths, it's possible to have separate\nenvelopes modulating the volume of different oscillators, for\nexample using a shorter envelope to turn a noise oscillator into\na short transient.\n\nIf more envelope stages are required, an [SFZ2 envelope](/modulations/envelope_generators) with an\narbitrary amount of points can be used to modulate amplitude\ninstead of the SFZ1 envelope above.\n\nIn the ARIA SFZ player, amplifier envelope durations are calculated\nonce on trigger, which means changing envelope parameters other than\nsustain and release while a note is playing will not change the sound.\nThe [ampeg_dynamic](/opcodes/ampeg_dynamic) opcode could be set to 1 in order to recalculate\nenvelope parameters every time one of the control parameters receives\na MIDI message, which could be closer to the behavior of most\nanalog synthesizer hardware.\n\nCaveman Cosmonaut has a more unusual parameter called Env Soften,\nwhich has no effect on some oscillators which have more\nhigh-frequency content, and adds to the release and decay times\nof the warmer-sounding oscillators. This is highly unusual, but\ncan be musically useful for things such as plucks, as the warmer\nsounds linger longer. This is similar to the effect of release\nor decay on a lowpass filter cutoff, but perhaps a little more\norganic. That's set per oscillator, rather than globally, like\nthis, with CC 18 selecting the oscillator, and CC 106 being the\nenvelope soften:\n\n```\n\u003cmaster\u003e\nlocc18=11\nhicc18=20\nampeg_decay_oncc106=1.25\nampeg_release_oncc106=0.7\n#include \"mappings/unitra_flutes.sfz\"\n\n\u003cmaster\u003e\nlocc18=21\nhicc18=30\nampeg_decay_oncc106=1\nampeg_release_oncc106=0.4\n#include \"mappings/unitra_clarinet.sfz\"\n\n\u003cmaster\u003e\nlocc18=31\nhicc18=40\nampeg_decay_oncc106=1.5\nampeg_release_oncc106=0.6\n#include \"mappings/unitra_trombone.sfz\"\n\n\u003cmaster\u003e\nlocc18=41\nhicc18=50\nampeg_decay_oncc106=0.5\nampeg_release_oncc106=0.2\n#include \"mappings/unitra_trompette.sfz\"\n\n\u003cmaster\u003e\nlocc18=51\nhicc18=60\nampeg_decay_oncc106=1.25\nampeg_release_oncc106=0.5\n#include \"mappings/unitra_violin.sfz\"\n\n\u003cmaster\u003e\nlocc18=61\nhicc18=70\n#include \"mappings/unitra_tremolo.sfz\"\n\n\u003cmaster\u003e\nlocc18=71\n#include \"mappings/unitra_all.sfz\"\n```\n\n## Basic filter\n\nThe filter in the example instrument is a single [lowpass](/opcodes/fil_type) filter\nwith [cutoff](/opcodes/cutoff) and [resonance](/opcodes/resonance) controls,\nadjustable [velocity](/extensions/midi_ccs) tracking using [var](/opcodes/varNN_mod)\na two-stage [filter cutoff envelope](/opcodes/fileg_attack).\n\n```\n\u003ccontrol\u003e\nlabel_cc120=Filter cutoff\nlabel_cc121=Resonance\nlabel_cc124=Veltrack\nlabel_cc125=Pluck\nlabel_cc126=Filter attack\nlabel_cc127=Filter decay\n\nset_cc120=127\nset_cc127=40\n\n\u003cglobal\u003e\n//Lowpass filter\ncutoff=250\ncutoff_cc120=9600\nfil_keytrack=100\nresonance=0\nresonance_cc121=18\nvar01_cutoff=6000 //Velocity track\nvar01_mod=mult\nvar01_oncc131=1\nvar01_oncc124=1\ncutoff_cc124=-3000\n//Pluck envelope\nfileg_depth=0\nfileg_depthcc125=8400\nfileg_sustain=0\nfileg_attack=0\nfileg_attackcc126=0.5\nfileg_decay=0.001\nfileg_decaycc127=2\n```\n\n## Filter keytracking\n\nMaking the filter cutoff keytrack is a simple matter of\nsetting the [fil_keytrack](/opcodes/fil_keytrack) to 100; however, things get\nmore complicated if filter keytracking is not desired.\nAlthough fil_keytrack can be set to 0 and the base\nfilter cutoff will then not keytrack, the filter cutoff\nmodulation in SFZ is specified in cents, not Hertz. This\nmeans the amount of the cutoff which is modulated will\nkeytrack, regardless of what fil_keytrack is set to. This\nisn't a big issue with most synthesizers, but when trying\nto make an adjustable highpass filter for all pieces of\na drum kit except the kick, for example, it can make\nthings complicated.\n\nAdjusting keytracking for the modulated amount requires\nusing var and the extended CC 133 (MIDI key number).\nVar and extended CCs are already used above for the\nvelocity tracking on the filter cutoff. The example instrument\nhas a somewhat convoluted and unusual configuration for\nthe filter keytracking, where when CC 120 has a very\nhigh value, the cutoff will be slightly above 22.05 kHz\nfor all keys in the instrument's range, while the cutoff\nwhen CC 120 is at zero has 70% keytracking. This is not\nat all standard, and means the base cutoff has moderate\npositive keytracking while the cutoff modulation has\nnegative keytracking.\n\n```\n//By default, cutoff modulation is measured in cents\n//To make the modulation not keytrack, we make a kludge\n//Using var\ncutoff=250\nvar02_cutoff=9000\nvar02_mod=mult\nvar02_oncc120=1\nvar02_curvecc120=0\nvar02_oncc133=1\nvar02_curvecc133=11\nfil_keytrack=70\n```\n\nAt the end of the SFZ file, the [curve](/headers/curve) is then specified:\n\n```\n\u003ccurve\u003e\ncurve_index=11\nv000=1\nv024=1\nv084=0.63\nv127=0.25\n```\n\n## More filter possibilities\n\nIt would be easy to have more filter envelope stages; only\nattack and decay are used above to keep things simple, as\nthose parameters are enough to create basic plucks (zero\nattack, moderate decay) and 303 style basses (slightly\nlonger attack, moderate decay).\n\nUsing fil2_type and cutoff2 allows two filters in series,\nfor example a lowpass and highpass filter. Fil_type can\nalso be used to choose different filter types, perhaps with\n[locc/hicc](/opcodes/loccN).\n\nModulating the filter cutoff with LFOs is added below, in the\nvibrato section.\n\n## Vibrato\n\nVibrato can affect pitch, volume (for tremolo) and filter cutoff\n(for wobble). Here is a typical setup using one [LFO](/modulations/lfo) to modulate\nall three.\n\n```\n\u003ccontrol\u003e\nlabel_cc111=Vibrato to pitch\nlabel_cc112=Vibrato speed\nlabel_cc113=Vibrato to cutoff\nlabel_cc114=Vibrato to volume\nlabel_cc115=Vibrato delay\nlabel_cc116=Vibrato fade\n\nset_cc112=40\n\n\u003cglobal\u003e\nlfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 //Vibrato LFO\nlfo01_freq=0.1\nlfo01_freq_oncc112=9.9\nlfo01_delay_oncc115=0.500\nlfo01_fade_oncc116=0.500\nlfo01_volume_oncc114=6\n//Wobble\nlfo01_cutoff=0\nlfo01_cutoff_oncc113=3600\n```\n\n## Humanized vibrato\n\nHumanization is obviously not a standard feature of synthesizers.\nTechnically, though, it's not difficult to implement.\n\nThe example instrument adds CC 117 for controlling the\namount of randomization\nof the vibrato LFOs. This is similar to the humanization\ndescribed in the [vibrato tutorial](/tutorials/vibrato), but using CC 135 to\ngenerate a true random number for each voice, which\nmeans any unison voices' vibrato will drift out of sync\nwith those belonging to other voices. This is musically\nuseful for creating more complex pads, for example. Similar\nprinciples could also be used to emulate analog oscillators'\nmuch more subtle pitch drift.\n\n```\n\u003ccontrol\u003e\nlabel_cc111=Vibrato to pitch\nlabel_cc112=Vibrato speed\nlabel_cc113=Vibrato to cutoff\nlabel_cc114=Vibrato to volume\nlabel_cc115=Vibrato delay\nlabel_cc116=Vibrato fade\nlabel_cc117=Vibrato humanize\n\nset_cc112=40\n\n\u003cglobal\u003e\n//Vibrato and humanization setup\nlfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 //Vibrato LFO\nlfo01_freq=0.1\nlfo01_freq_oncc112=9.9\nlfo01_delay_oncc115=0.500\nlfo01_fade_oncc116=0.500\nlfo01_volume_oncc114=6\n//Wobble\nlfo01_cutoff=0\nlfo01_cutoff_oncc113=3600\n\nlfo02_wave=1 //Second LFO to make things wobblier\nlfo02_phase=0\nlfo02_phase_oncc135=1 //Phase randomized\nlfo02_freq=0.01 //Basically no movement at very slow speeds, just randomization\nlfo02_freq_oncc117=1 //Max rate is not very high, so it doesn't sound too obvious\nlfo02_pitch_oncc117=6 //Slight pitch wobbliness\nlfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=0.5 //Affect the rate of the other LFO for unsteady vibrato\nlfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc112=2.5 //Faster when the first LFO is going faster\n\nlfo03_wave=1 //And a third LFO for secondhand complex wobbliness\nlfo03_phase=0.4\nlfo03_phase_oncc135=0.179 //Different phase response to random than the second LFO\nlfo03_freq=0.5\nlfo03_freq_oncc117=-0.4\nlfo03_freq_lfo2_oncc117=1\nlfo03_pitch_oncc117=-4\n\nlfo04_wave=1 //Fourth LFO for slowly changing the oscillator mix\nlfo04_phase_oncc135=1\nlfo04_freq=0.01\nlfo04_freq_oncc135=0.25 //Randomly from almost not moving at all to still pretty slow\nlfo04_volume_oncc117=1.5 //Slight volume changes\n```\n\n## Unison and detune\n\nUnison is a simple matter of triggering multiple regions\nwith one MIDI note. If using a simple sound source such\nas a saw oscillators, all regions will sound identical so\nthe only result will be additional volume. Making the\nunison more interesting requires some of: using different\nsamples for each voice, detuning the voices, and shifting\nthe phase of the voices.\n\nThe example instrument uses many sets of samples from an\nanalog keyboard, with every key producing a slightly\ndifferent timbre, and transposed versions of those sounds\nused for unison. The [detune](/opcodes/pitch_onccN) and width amounts vary for\neach of the three oscillators, but here is a simplified\nversion assuming there is only one oscillator.\n\nNote that although there is a [width](/opcodes/width) opcodes for\nuse with stereo samples, in this case the left channel and right are\nseparate mono samples, so [pan](/opcodes/pan) is used to spread them\nin stereo - not width.\n\nAs the samples here are quite long, [offset_random](/opcodes/offset_random)\nis applied globally to effecitvely randomize each voice's phase. With\ntrue single-cycle waveforms, the max offset would have to be set to\nmatch each voice's max sample length.\n```\n\u003ccontrol\u003e\nlabel_cc25=Unison\nlabel_cc26=Width\nlabel_cc27=Detune\n\nset_cc26=63\nset_cc27=63\n\n\u003cglobal\u003e\n//Randomizing the start points of the samples to randomize phase\noffset_random=1000\n\n//Center voice\n\u003cmaster\u003e\n#include \"sample_map_basic.sfz\"\n\n//Left voice\n\u003cregion\u003e\namplitude_cc25=100\namplitude_cc25=100\nlocc25=1\npan_cc26=-100\ntune_cc27=-33\n#include \"sample_map_transposed_1.sfz\"\n\n//Right voice\n\u003cregion\u003e\namplitude_cc25=100\nlocc25=1\npan_cc26=100\ntune_cc27=33\namplitude_cc25=100\n#include \"sample_map_transposed_2.sfz\"\n```\n\n## More complex detune\n\nAnother highly unsual feature of Caveman Cosmonaut, though, is\nthat the detune doesn't have to be fixed.

We can \"stretch\" one of the\nneighboring notes to cover that D# and that F using the\n[lokey, hikey](/opcodes/lokey) and\n[pitch_keycenter](/opcodes/pitch_keycenter) opcodes instead of key.\nIf a sample does not need to cover multiple notes, it can still use key.

However, it' is quite common,\nespecially with string instruments, to use a MIDI CC to control the dynamics of\nsustained articulations, and velocity to control the dynamics of short\narticulations such as staccato. In those cases, the short articulations could\nuse amp_veltrack set to 100 instead of 0, and generally be mapped in the same\nway as [the drums we've discussed before](/tutorials/drum_basics).

Using just one octave of range for simplicity, this is our first\nviolins example:\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003e\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4.wav key=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=db4.wav key=49\n\u003cregion\u003esample=d4.wav key=50\n\u003cregion\u003esample=eb4.wav key=51\n\u003cregion\u003esample=e4.wav key=52\n\u003cregion\u003esample=f4.wav key=53\n\u003cregion\u003esample=gb4.wav key=54\n\u003cregion\u003esample=g4.wav key=55\n\u003cregion\u003esample=ab4.wav key=56\n\u003cregion\u003esample=a4.wav key=57\n\u003cregion\u003esample=bb4.wav key=58\n\u003cregion\u003esample=b4.wav key=59\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c5.wav key=60\n```\n\nUsing this for both first and second violins will result in two identical-sounding\nsections with the same timbre, but it's easily possible to use the same samples\ntransposed, and get a different timbre. Instead of using the C4 sample to play C4,\nuse the Db4 sample transposed down a half step to play C4. This can be done by\nusing lokey, hikey and pitch_keycenter opcodes instead of just key.\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4.wav lokey=47 hikey=47 pitch_keycenter=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=db4.wav lokey=48 hikey=48 pitch_keycenter=49\n\u003cregion\u003esample=d4.wav lokey=49 hikey=49 pitch_keycenter=50\n\u003cregion\u003esample=eb4.wav lokey=50 hikey=50 pitch_keycenter=51\n\u003cregion\u003esample=e4.wav lokey=51 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=52\n\u003cregion\u003esample=f4.wav lokey=52 hikey=52 pitch_keycenter=53\n\u003cregion\u003esample=gb4.wav lokey=53 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=54\n\u003cregion\u003esample=g4.wav lokey=54 hikey=54 pitch_keycenter=55\n\u003cregion\u003esample=ab4.wav lokey=55 hikey=55 pitch_keycenter=56\n\u003cregion\u003esample=a4.wav lokey=56 hikey=56 pitch_keycenter=57\n\u003cregion\u003esample=bb4.wav lokey=57 hikey=57 pitch_keycenter=58\n\u003cregion\u003esample=b4.wav lokey=58 hikey=58 pitch_keycenter=59\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c5.wav lokey=59 hikey=59 pitch_keycenter=60\n```\n\nHowerver, in most cases it's easier to use the key and transpose opcodes instead,\nand set the transpose amount for all the transposed regions at once.\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003e\ntranspose=-1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4.wav key=47\n\u003cregion\u003esample=db4.wav key=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=d4.wav key=49\n\u003cregion\u003esample=eb4.wav key=50\n\u003cregion\u003esample=e4.wav key=51\n\u003cregion\u003esample=f4.wav key=52\n\u003cregion\u003esample=gb4.wav key=53\n\u003cregion\u003esample=g4.wav key=54\n\u003cregion\u003esample=ab4.wav key=55\n\u003cregion\u003esample=a4.wav key=56\n\u003cregion\u003esample=bb4.wav key=57\n\u003cregion\u003esample=b4.wav key=58\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c5.wav key=59\n```\n\nThis still requires changing the key opcode for every region, however. Doing\nthis editing manually on large sample sets would be time-consuming, but\nthe old tool sfzed allows easily adding, subtracting or multiplying current\nparameter values to regions, which becomes very useful when doing this with\nthousands of samples.\n\nThis shifts the entire range of the instrument down by a half-step, though. In\norder to preserve the correct range, we can remove the transposed notes which\ngot moved below the lowest pitch the instrument is capable of. That's easy. The\ntop range is more tricky - if we extend the highest note to cover its original\npitch as well, but then the same sample would be used for the same pitch by\nboth sections. So, we can instead use the next-to-highest note, transposed up.\nThis might not sound very consistent with the rest, but under these limitations,\nit can be a reasonable compromise.\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003e\ntranspose=-1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=db4.wav key=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=d4.wav key=49\n\u003cregion\u003esample=eb4.wav key=50\n\u003cregion\u003esample=e4.wav key=51\n\u003cregion\u003esample=f4.wav key=52\n\u003cregion\u003esample=gb4.wav key=53\n\u003cregion\u003esample=g4.wav key=54\n\u003cregion\u003esample=ab4.wav key=55\n\u003cregion\u003esample=a4.wav key=56\n\u003cregion\u003esample=bb4.wav key=57\n\u003cregion\u003esample=b4.wav key=58\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c5.wav key=59\n\u003cregion\u003esample=b4.wav key=60 transpose=1\n```\n\n## Transposition Values\n\nIn general, transposing downwards will result in a warmer sound, and transposing\nupwards will make the sound brighter and thinner. Transposing by more than a half\nstep can be a good idea. In general, transposing by a minor third is a common way\nto create a big change in timbre. Transposing by much more than a minor third\ndoesn't seem common outside of sound design not intended to be a realistic instrument\nemulation.\n\nTransposing down by a minor third while preserving the range in our example, and\nfilling in the lost top of the range by transposing upwards might look like this:\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003e\ntranspose=-3\n\u003cregion\u003esample=eb4.wav key=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=e4.wav key=49\n\u003cregion\u003esample=f4.wav key=50\n\u003cregion\u003esample=gb4.wav key=51\n\u003cregion\u003esample=g4.wav key=52\n\u003cregion\u003esample=ab4.wav key=53\n\u003cregion\u003esample=a4.wav key=54\n\u003cregion\u003esample=bb4.wav key=55\n\u003cregion\u003esample=b4.wav key=56\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c5.wav key=57\n\u003cregion\u003esample=a4.wav key=58 transpose=1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=bb4.wav key=59 transpose=1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=b4.wav key=60 transpose=1\n```\n\n## Unison By Transposition\n\nIf we put both the original and transposed samples in the same SFZ file, each MIDI\nnote will trigger two regions, and we now will have the sound of an ensemble which\nis twice as large as what was actually sampled.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4.wav key=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=db4.wav key=49\n\u003cregion\u003esample=d4.wav key=50\n\u003cregion\u003esample=eb4.wav key=51\n\u003cregion\u003esample=e4.wav key=52\n\u003cregion\u003esample=f4.wav key=53\n\u003cregion\u003esample=gb4.wav key=54\n\u003cregion\u003esample=g4.wav key=55\n\u003cregion\u003esample=ab4.wav key=56\n\u003cregion\u003esample=a4.wav key=57\n\u003cregion\u003esample=bb4.wav key=58\n\u003cregion\u003esample=b4.wav key=59\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c5.wav key=60\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\ntranspose=-1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=db4.wav key=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=d4.wav key=49\n\u003cregion\u003esample=eb4.wav key=50\n\u003cregion\u003esample=e4.wav key=51\n\u003cregion\u003esample=f4.wav key=52\n\u003cregion\u003esample=gb4.wav key=53\n\u003cregion\u003esample=g4.wav key=54\n\u003cregion\u003esample=ab4.wav key=55\n\u003cregion\u003esample=a4.wav key=56\n\u003cregion\u003esample=bb4.wav key=57\n\u003cregion\u003esample=b4.wav key=58\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c5.wav key=59\n\u003cregion\u003esample=b4.wav key=60 transpose=1\n```\n\n## Unison By Round Robin\n\nFor cases where the goal is to emulate overdubbed copies of the same instrument\nwith the same timbre, rather than different instruments with different timbres,\nit's still necessary to avoid triggering the same samples. This can be done\nby using different round robins for each simultaneously playing sample. This\nis how guitar multitracking is often emulated. Using one note with four round\nrobins as an example:\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003eseq_length=4 key=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr1.wav seq_position=1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr2.wav seq_position=2\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr3.wav seq_position=3\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr4.wav seq_position=4\n```\n\nWe can create two by offsetting the round robins like this:\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003eseq_length=4 key=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr1.wav seq_position=1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr2.wav seq_position=2\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr3.wav seq_position=3\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr4.wav seq_position=4\n\u003cgroup\u003eseq_length=4 key=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr1.wav seq_position=4\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr2.wav seq_position=1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr3.wav seq_position=2\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr4.wav seq_position=3\n```\n\nThe group headers aren't necessary and everything could be under one group,\nbut for organizational purposes, they can make things easier.\n\nOr three, or a maximum of four:\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003eseq_length=4 key=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr1.wav seq_position=1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr2.wav seq_position=2\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr3.wav seq_position=3\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr4.wav seq_position=4\n\u003cgroup\u003eseq_length=4 key=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr1.wav seq_position=4\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr2.wav seq_position=1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr3.wav seq_position=2\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr4.wav seq_position=3\n\u003cgroup\u003eseq_length=4 key=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr1.wav seq_position=3\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr2.wav seq_position=4\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr3.wav seq_position=1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr4.wav seq_position=2\n\u003cgroup\u003eseq_length=4 key=48\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr1.wav seq_position=2\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr2.wav seq_position=3\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr3.wav seq_position=4\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr4.wav seq_position=1\n```\n\nNote that this will not work well with random round robins, as it's\npossible that the same sample will be randomly selected for multiple\nregions.\n\n## Width And Detune\n\nMultitracked guitars will often be spread in stereo, as will unison voices\nin synthesizers etc. Spreading the above quad-tracked guitar in stereo\nis simple:\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003eseq_length=4 key=48\npan=-100\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr1.wav seq_position=1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr2.wav seq_position=2\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr3.wav seq_position=3\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr4.wav seq_position=4\n\u003cgroup\u003eseq_length=4 key=48\npan=100\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr1.wav seq_position=4\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr2.wav seq_position=1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr3.wav seq_position=2\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr4.wav seq_position=3\n\u003cgroup\u003eseq_length=4 key=48\npan=-50\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr1.wav seq_position=3\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr2.wav seq_position=4\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr3.wav seq_position=1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr4.wav seq_position=2\n\u003cgroup\u003eseq_length=4 key=48\npan=50\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr1.wav seq_position=2\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr2.wav seq_position=3\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr3.wav seq_position=4\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c4_rr4.wav seq_position=1\n```\n\nIt's also possible to apply slight detuning to each voice. That's probably\nnot common with guitars, and unnecessary with section recordings where natural\ntuning differences will already be captured in the recordings, but it is very\ncommon in synthesizers, and can also be helpful when trying to turn solo\ninstrument samples into a small section. Detune can even be used by itself\nto create multiple voices, and this is an especially viable approach for\nsynthesizers. The amount of detune, as well as width, can be modulated. Here\nis an example of a saw oscillator with seven voices.\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003esample=*saw\n\u003cregion\u003epitch_oncc100=20 pan_oncc101=100 sample=*saw\n\u003cregion\u003epitch_oncc100=-20 pan_oncc101=-100 sample=*saw\n\u003cregion\u003epitch_oncc100=30 pan_oncc101=67 sample=*saw\n\u003cregion\u003epitch_oncc100=-30 pan_oncc101=-67 sample=*saw\n\u003cregion\u003epitch_oncc100=40 pan_oncc101=33 sample=*saw\n\u003cregion\u003epitch_oncc100=-40 pan_oncc101=-33 sample=*saw\n```\n\n## Legato\n\nWhen self-muting is implemented, each set of unison samples will need to have its\nown polyphony groups, same as would be needed with multiple microphone positions.\n\nIf there are true legato samples, that adds considerable complexity to the\ntransposition trick. The below steps are not a universal set of instructions, but\nhave worked successfully for at least one instrument.\n\n* Create an extended-range map extending the range by the largest transposition amount in the direction opposite of the transposition. For example, if there are four transposed voices and are to be transposed down by a half-step, a full step, a minor third and a major third, add a major third of range to the top of the extended map. See [the range extension tutorial](/tutorials/range_extension) for details.\n* Make copies of this extended map to create the to-be-transposed maps.\n* In each map, add the aomount of shift for the particular map (for example -1) to lokey, hikey and sw_previous.\n* Delete any regions with lokey or hikey above or below the final desired range, which might be both at the top and bottom of a map.\n* Delete any regions with sw_previous above or below the final desired range. This isn't strictly necessary as those regions \"should\" never be played, but will reduce parsing time and prevent weirdness when a note slightly outside the range is held by mistake and a note inside the range is pressed.\n\n## Humanization\n\nWhen trying to emulate the sound of a larger section of instruments, especially when\ntrying to turn a solo instrument into an emulated section, it can be useful to\ncreate small differences between each voice, especially when vibrato and legato\nare also emulated. This is probably not that important with sampled ensembles, such\nas emulating second violins, but with solo instruments it becomes crucial. Without\nindependent per-voice humanization, emulated vibrato and legato can sound more like\na solo instrument run through a chorus or other doubling effect, rather than separate\nperformances.\n\nAspects of the sound which can be humanized or randomized include timing, smoothing,\nphase, pitch, vibrato speed and vibrato depth.\n\nHere is a rather lengthy example, adapted from a real instrument, where each voice has\nseparate pan settings for stereo spread and separate polyphony groups - these are basic\nfeatures of unison, and not related to humanization, of course. The humanizing\ndifferences between the voices are differences in bend smoothing, in maximum vibrato\ndepth, in the initial phase of the vibrato humanization LFOs, and in the fade times of\nthe legato regions.

This means every other note repeat has a slightly\ndifferent timbre, but it should sound more acceptable than\nusing untransposed notes for the first three sequence positions\nand transposed notes for positions four through six. So, we\nincrease the sequence length to six, and alternate between\ntransposed and untransposed samples like this:\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003e\nseq_length=6\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nseq_position=1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c5_rr1.wav key=60\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c#5_rr1.wav key=61\n\u003cregion\u003esample=d5_rr1.wav key=62\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nseq_position=2\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c#5_rr1.wav key=60 transpose=-1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=d5_rr1.wav key=61 transpose=-1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c#5_rr1.wav key=62 transpose=1\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nseq_position=3\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c5_rr2.wav key=60\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c#5_rr2.wav key=61\n\u003cregion\u003esample=d5_rr2.wav key=62\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nseq_position=4\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c#5_rr2.wav key=60 transpose=-1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=d5_rr2.wav key=61 transpose=-1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c#5_rr2.wav key=62 transpose=1\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nseq_position=5\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c5_rr3.wav key=60\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c#5_rr3.wav key=61\n\u003cregion\u003esample=d5_rr3.wav key=62\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nseq_position=6\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c#5_rr3.wav key=60 transpose=-1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=d5_rr3.wav key=61 transpose=-1\n\u003cregion\u003esample=c#5_rr3.wav key=62 transpose=1\n```\n\nIt's also possible to triple the amount of round robins by\nborrowing neighbors in both upwards and downwards direction\nfor each note (except the lowest and highest note in the range,\nof course). In general, transposing by more than a half-step\nis not a good idea, as the timbral differences grow larger with\nlarger transposition, but with some instruments it can be\npossible to get away with it. If there are many dynamic layers\navailable, it's also possible to borrow from nearby dynamic layers,\nespecially in the case of drums.\n"},{"slug":["vibrato"],"title":"Vibrato","content":"Emulating vibrato for solo instruments or voices with LFOs is not difficult. The challenges\nare understanding the key aspects of vibrato on the real instrument, and keeping the number of\nparameters from growing too large to be easy to use. The examples here use SFZ 2 spec [numbered\nLFOs](/modulations/lfo.html), rather than the [dedicated pitch, volume and filter LFOs](/opcodes/amplfo_depth)\nand envelopes of SFZ 1. A lot of this can be done under the SFZ 1 specification as well, but\nthere are some limitations.\n\nThe most basic, typical vibrato is pitch vibrato - just an LFO modulating pitch. Making the\nminimum and maximum rates and depths that would be used by players in real life is important,\nof course. The numbers here are examples which would be decent for bowed strings - it has a\nrate of 2-10 Hz and a maximum depth of 35 cents. Wider and slower are certainly possible\non real instruments, but isn't commonly used in performance.\n```\nlfo01_pitch_oncc111=35\nlfo01_freq=2\nlfo01_freq_oncc112=8\n```\nIn real life, however, players and singers will often start a note without vibrato,\nand add vibrato a fraction of a second later. This is where modulating the [LFO delay parameter](/opcodes/lfoN_delay)\nbecomes useful, and possibly [LFO fade](/opcodes/lfoN_fade) as well. Delay seems like enough for most wind\ninstruments and vocals, but having both delay and fade seems effective with bowed strings.\n```\nlfo01_pitch_oncc111=35\nlfo01_freq=2\nlfo01_freq_oncc112=8\nlfo01_delay_oncc115=0.500\nlfo01_fade_oncc116=0.500\n```\nVibrato on many instruments doesn't just affect pitch; on bowed strings, it seems to have\na subtle effect on volume and timbre as well. We can have the same MIDI CC parameter control\nhow much the vibrato LFO affects pitch, volume, and an EQ band, with the latter two being\nquite subtle.\n\nThis is a good a time as any to note that not all vibrato is equal - it's not really\npractical to add vibrato to the lowest note playable on a cello, for example, or to a\nnatural harmonic. With pizzicato, vibrato is possible, but probably should not affect the\nEQ band, and either only affect pitch or pitch plus a subtle effect on volume. The below\nwill work reasonably for most bowed notes, however.\n```\nlfo01_pitch_oncc111=35\nlfo01_volume_oncc111=1\nlfo01_freq=2\nlfo01_freq_oncc112=8\nlfo01_delay_oncc115=0.500\nlfo01_fade_oncc116=0.500\neq1_freq=2000\neq1_bw=2\nlfo01_eq1gain_oncc111=2\nlfo01_eq1freq_oncc111=500\n```\nVibrato can also be humanized, by varying the rate of the vibrato LFO. This can be done\nby modulating the rate of the vibrato LFO with another LFO. The ARIA sample \u0026 hold\n[waveform](/opcodes/lfoN_wave.html) can be used here, and the modulation depth controlled by MIDI CC, so when that's\nat zero, no humanization happens.\n```\nlfo02_freq=1\nlfo02_wave=12 //Sample \u0026 hold LFO waveform number\nlfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1\n```\nOr, to stay in the SFZ 2 spec and not use ARIA extensions, a sine wave with randomized\n[starting phase](/opcodes/lfoN_phase) will also work:\n```\nlfo02_freq=1\nlfo02_phase_oncc135=1\nlfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1\n```\nHowever, when playing multiple layers, such as sustain samples with crossfaded dynamics\nor multiple mic positions, this can cause each layer's vibrato to drift out of sync and\nsound like separate instruments. This is generally not desirable, so it is possible to\npseudo-randomize the starting phase using a non-random [CC, such as velocity](/extensions/midi_ccs.html)\n(which is often otherwise unused in sustain sounds with crossfaded dynamics). If the SFZ\nplayer can have a global sample and hold LFO which does not retrigger for each note, this\nwould also be a solution, though ARIA does not allow this.\n```\nlfo02_freq=1\nlfo02_phase_oncc132=0.7\nlfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1\n```\nFor additional complexity, it's also possible to have the random LFO itself modulate pitch,\nwhich will create some pitch drift, and have more than two LFOs involved. Here is a fairly\nsophisticated example.\n```\n//Vibrato\nlfo01_pitch_oncc21=29 //Vibrato LFO\nlfo01_freq=2 //Any slower than this sounds really lousy\nlfo01_freq_oncc112=6 //8 Hz is about as fast as vibrato on cello can go\nlfo01_delay_oncc115=0.500\nlfo01_fade_oncc116=0.500\n//This LFO also does tremolo\nlfo01_volume_oncc21=1 //Not much - just a subtle effect on volume\neq1_freq=2200 //EQ band for vibrato\neq1_bw=2\nlfo01_eq1gain_oncc21=3 //Again, pretty subtle\n\nlfo02_wave=1 //Second LFO to make things wobblier\nlfo02_phase=0\nlfo02_phase_oncc131=0.7 //Phase affected by velocity, to pseudo-randomize while keeping both mics' LFOs in sync\nlfo02_freq=0.01 //Basically no movement at very slow speeds, just randomization\nlfo02_freq_oncc117=1 //Max rate is not very high, so it doesn't sound too obvious\nlfo02_pitch_oncc117=6 //Slight pitch wobbliness\nlfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1 //Affect the rate of the other LFO for unsteady vibrato\n\nlfo03_wave=1 //And a third LFO for secondhand complex wobbliness\nlfo03_phase=0.4\nlfo03_phase_oncc131=0.479 //Different phase response to velocity than the second LFO\nlfo03_freq=0.5\nlfo03_freq_oncc117=-0.4\nlfo03_freq_lfo2_oncc117=1\nlfo03_pitch_oncc117=-4\n```\nSomething similar to the above will work fairly well for a range of strings and voices.\nHowever, there are cases where vibrato should only go in one direction - for example,\nbending guitar strings only moves the pitch upwards, while on saxophone it's possible\nto play vibrato centered around the pitch, but most of the time players will go only\nbelow the pitch. Let's use saxophone vibrato as an example.\n\nTo have vibrato which will go below the main pitch is simple - the LFO phase can be\nset so the wave starts at the top, and the note [tuned](/opcodes/tune) down by the vibrato depth amount.\n```\nlfo01_pitch_oncc111=20\nlfo01_phase=0.25\nlfo01_freq=1.5\nlfo01_freq_oncc112=6\npitch_oncc111=-20\n```\nThis will work fine, as long as we don't try to apply delay or fade to the LFO, which\nwould result in the note starting out flat with no vibrato. To solve that problem, we\ncan combine the LFO with a pitch [envelope](/modulations/envelope_generators.html). Here is an example with just delay:\n```\nlfo01_pitch_oncc111=20\nlfo01_freq=1.5\nlfo01_freq_oncc112=6\nlfo01_phase=0.25\nlfo01_delay_oncc116=1\npitcheg_delay_oncc116=1\npitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20\n```\nTo have the choice of idiomatic sax vibrato and violin-style vibrato centered around the pitch\ncan be done separate LFOs and separate depth controls. It's also possible to duplicate all the\nregions and use [loccN/hiccN](/opcodes/loccN.html) to select between ones with different styles of vibrato.\n```\nlfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Sax vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitch\nlfo01_freq=1.5\nlfo01_freq_oncc112=6\nlfo01_phase=0.25 //Starts at top\nlfo01_delay_oncc116=1\npitcheg_delay_oncc116=1 //Pitch envelope to drop the central pitch when sax vibrato kicks in\npitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20\n\nlfo02_pitch_oncc114=20 //Violin vibrato LFO - goes below and above main pitch\nlfo02_freq=1.5\nlfo02_freq_oncc112=6 //Same rate as the first LFO\nlfo02_phase=0.5 //Starts in the middle, goes down first before going up\nlfo02_delay_oncc116=1 //Same delay, too\n```\nThis covers jaw vibrato, but sax players also use diaphragm vibrato, which changes volume\nand has no effect on pitch, which means there are now three vibrato depths. Having the\nvolume modulated by the second LFO is a little easier, as the phase setting of the first\nLFO would mean having to apply a volume envelope as well.\n```\nlfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Sax vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitch\nlfo01_freq=1.5\nlfo01_freq_oncc112=6\nlfo01_phase=0.25 //Starts at top\nlfo01_delay_oncc116=1\npitcheg_delay_oncc116=1 //Pitch envelope to drop the central pitch when sax vibrato kicks in\npitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20\n\nlfo02_pitch_oncc114=20 //Violin vibrato LFO - goes below and above main pitch\nlfo02_freq=1.5\nlfo02_freq_oncc112=6 //Same rate as the first LFO\nlfo02_delay_oncc116=1 //Same delay, too\nlfo02_phase=0.5 //Starts in the middle, goes down first before going up\nlfo02_volume=0 //This LFO also does tremolo\nlfo02_volume_oncc113=3\n```\nThere is one additional consideration with diaphragm vibrato - when\nthe volume of the note drops down, the breath noise can become more prominent, especially on\nquiet notes or when using the subtone technique. If the volume of the breath noise can be\nmodulated separately, the noise regions should not be affected by pitch vibrato, and be\naffected by the diaphragm vibrato in an opposite direction to the notes. So, if the above\nvibrato settings are set under a [global header](/headers/global.html), the breath noise\nsample regions could have settings similar to this.\n```\nlfo01_pitch_oncc111=0 //LFOs do not affect pitch\npitcheg_depth_oncc111=0\nlfo02_pitch_oncc114=0\nlfo02_volume_oncc113=-3 //Diaphragm vibrato affects volume in the opposite direction\n```\nHumanization and having the diaphragm vibrato affect timbre can be done similarly as with\nthe strings above, ensuring both LFOs are humanized in sync with each other, so they do not\ndrift apart.\n\nSome instruments will have vibrato types which require special treatment, for example guitar\ntremolo bridges will bend each string's pitch by a different amount when playing chords. This\nrequires different pitch modulation depths for each string. Vibrato can also be used to\nmodulate [filter cutoffs](/opcodes/cutoff), which is commonly used in synthesizers to create\nevolving pads or wobble basses. This is not difficult to implement. Here is an example of a\nsynthesizer style vibrato with a typical lowpass filter, and vibrato which can affect pitch,\nvolume or filter cutoff.\n```\n//Filter\n//Lowpass filter\ncutoff=120\ncutoff_cc120=13200\nfil_keytrack=100\nresonance=0\nresonance_cc121=12\n\n//Vibrato\nlfo01_freq=1\nlfo01_freq_oncc112=11\nlfo01_delay_oncc115=0.500\nlfo01_fade_oncc116=0.500\nlfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 //Vibrato LFO affects pitch\nlfo01_volume_oncc114=6 //Volume tremolo\nlfo01_cutoff=0 //Filter wobble\nlfo01_cutoff_oncc113=3600\n```\nThis by no means exhausts all the possibilties of vibrato. It does provide a decent combination of control and realism for a lot of common instrument types.\n"},{"slug":["videos"],"title":"SFZ Programming Video Tutorials","content":"Here are a couple of videos to help you get started with SFZ\n\n- [SFZ Tutorial Part 1][1]: Hello World! by [David Viens][a]\n- [SFZ Tutorial Part 2][2]: Generators, transpose and ADSR by [David Viens][a]\n- [VSCO 2: Community Edition - SFZ Tutorial][3] by [Versilian Studios][b]\n- [How to use our Free SFZ Instruments][4] by [Versilian Studios][b]\n- [Folder to SFZ Converter / Automapper][5] by [Sam Gossner][c]\n- [Sforzando introduction and overview][6] by [PatchArena][d]\n- [Getting Started with SFZ][7] by [David Hilowitz Music][e]\n- [How to make TRUE legato sample libraries in SFZ][9] by [David Hilowitz Music][e]\n- [Recording samples using Ardour and LinuxSampler][8] by [Sonoj Convention][f]\n\n[1]: https://youtu.be/bTFs524KrGc\n[2]: https://youtu.be/iWIRegt32o0\n[3]: https://youtu.be/-H5G72wm0s0\n[4]: https://youtu.be/VomafctByTs\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLdL4zn_x-4idW37c4wJ1S9n6VobRhGB4\n[6]: https://youtu.be/O62kISpCN9Y\n[7]: https://youtu.be/gmTmy6Byx6g\n[8]: https://media.ccc.de/v/sonoj2019-1904-recording-samples#t=1469\n[9]: https://youtu.be/j9OfaBw4n0c\n\n[a]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpTtSrRlp5wdTR3ngzs731w\n[b]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknu0fv59liI8a2_E3Jp9fA\n[c]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQpVDD813WYT2eOFvTqjgZw\n[d]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyOG7WKLHTZ8otfJ60ZY62Q\n[e]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCoAJ5JYKYTMubpTIsWi70w\n[f]: https://www.sonoj.org/archive/\n"},{"slug":["volume"],"title":"Control of volume","content":"The SFZ format allows many different ways of controlling volume. There's the\nmodulation of volume by opcodes, there's velocity tracking, and there's also\nmodualtion by envelopes and LFOs.\n\nThis is currently a work in progress, collecting information in tutorial form,\nthough it might be turned into another type of page eventually.\n\n## Opcodes affecting playback volume\n\nThe relevant opcodes are: [volume](/opcodes/volume), [amplitude](/opcodes/amplitude), \n[xfin/xfout](/opcodes/xfin_loccN), [amp_veltrack](/opcodes/amp_veltrack),\n[amp_keytrack](/opcodes/amp_keytrack), [amp_velcurve_N](/opcodes/amp_velcurve_N).\nThere are also envelope and LFO modulation sources: [ampeg](/opcodes/ampeg_attack), \n[amplfo](/opcodes/amplfo_depth), and volume-related targets for\n[egN and lfoN](/tutorials/sfz2_modulations). Some of them will have multiple stages,\npoints, CCs etc, so the volume of one sample can be affected by many different things\nat once.\n\n## Velocity tracking\n\nThis is affected by amp_veltrack and amp_velcurve_N. In addition, vel2 modulations\ncan affect amp envelope durations as well as the sustain level (though not the\npeak level at the end of the attack phase) and in ARIA extended CC 131 can also\nmodulate things which affect volume, for example egN levels.\n\nRemember that amp_veltrack is 100 by default, so if dynamics are to be controlled\nby things other than velocity and dynamics should be controlled, for examle, by\nmod wheel, then set amp_veltrack to 0, as in the code example in the next section.\n\nWhen using velocity layers, remember that a quiet velocity layer will have a certain\nmax velocity, for example if a region has [hivel](/opcodes/hivel) set to 31, it\nwill never be triggered by velocities higher than 31, and therefore should usually\neither have amp_velcurve_31 set to 1, or amp_veltrack should be set to 0.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nhivel=42\namp_velcurve_42=1\n#include \"quiet_layer.sfz\"\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nlovel=43\nhivel=84\namp_velcurve_84=1\n#include \"middle_layer.sfz\"\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\nlovel=85\n#include \"loud_layer.sfz\"\n```\n\n## Volume, amplitude and crossfade\n\nVolume, amplitude, and crossfade generally affect the playback volume of the entire\nregion, beginning to end. \"Generally\" because amplitude and volume can be modulated\nby CCs while the sample is playing.\n\nVolume is additive and measured in decibels, so volume=6 adds 6 dB to the sample's\nplayback volume. Amplitude is multiplicative, and is a percentage of full amplitude,\nso amplitude=6 would mean the sample is played at 6% amplitude.\n\nXfin and xfout are intended for cross-fading dynamic layers, and set the CC values for\nzero amplitude and full amplitude. One limitation here is that it's not possible to\nhave a layer which has more than zero amplitude at the start of the fade-in. This is\nimportant for instruments such as bowed strings, which have a certain minimum practical\nplayable loudness. These will often have dynamics linked to CC1 or some other CC, and\nneed to have some small amount of audible volume even at the lowest CC level. Here,\namplitude with [curveccN](/modulations/curveccN) can be used to fade in the lowest\nlayer. It's still possible to use xfout to fade the layer out at higher CC values as\nthe next layer fades in, though it may be simpler to just use amplitude for all layers,\nfor example like this:\n\n```\n\u003cglobal\u003e\namp_veltrack=0\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\namplitude_oncc1=100\namplitude_curvecc1=11\n#include \"quiet_layer.sfz\"\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\namplitude_oncc1=100\namplitude_curvecc1=12\n#include \"loud_layer.sfz\"\n\n\u003ccurve\u003e\ncurve_index=11\nv000=0.4\nv063=1\nv127=0\n\n\u003ccurve\u003e\ncurve_index=12\nv000=0\nv063=0\nv127=1\n```\n\n## Envelopes and LFOs\n\nBoth the ampeg envelope and one or more egN flex envelopes can be used in parallel.\nThe same is true of amplfo and lfoN flex LFOs. These affect the volume of the\nregion differently across time, obviously.\n\n## Randomization\n\n[amp_random](/opcodes/amp_random) and its alias gain_random work like volume/gain\nand are measured in decibels. In ARIA and Cakewalk, amp_random is unipolar. In the\nrgc sfz player, amp_random is bipolar.\n\nIn ARIA, CC135 (unipolar random) and 136 (bipolar random) can also be used by\nvarious opcodes which modulate volume.\n\n## Stacking mutliple modulations\n\nIt is possible to have multiple CCs modulating the same opcode for the same region.\nThis can make sense with multiple mic positions, for example. There can be a release\nsamples volume control affecting release sample amplitude for all mics, and individual\nmic controls with the amplitude for all samples recorded through that mic. The effect\nwith amplitude would be multiplicative - so with either control at 0, there would be\nno sound.\n\n```\n\u003cmaster\u003e\namplitude_oncc80=100 //Close mic volume\n\u003cgroup\u003e\n#include \"close_notes.sfz\"\n\u003cgroup\u003e\ntrigger=release\namplitude_oncc82=100 //Release noise volume\n#include \"close_releases.sfz\"\n\n\u003cmaster\u003e\namplitude_oncc81=100 //Far mic volume\n\u003cgroup\u003e\n#include \"far_notes.sfz\"\n\u003cgroup\u003e\ntrigger=release\namplitude_oncc82=100 //Release noise volume\n#include \"far_releases.sfz\"\n```\n"}]},{"name":"Syntax","root":"/documentation/syntax/","items":[{"slug":["extensions","aria","index"],"title":"Opcodes","content":"All opcode [versions], including extensions, starting in alphabetical order.\nNote that [modulations] such as (on)ccN and vel2* are included in the pages\ndescribing the parameters they modulate.\\\nRows in light pink color represent obsolete opcodes which should not be used\nin new instruments.\n\n\u003cdiv markdown=\"0\"\u003e\n{% include sfz/opcodes-table-generator.liquid %}\n{%-comment-%} Tables data is at /_data/sfz/syntax.yml {%-endcomment-%}\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n[modulations]: {{ '/modulations/' | relative_url }}\n[versions]:    {{ '/versions' | relative_url }}\n"},{"slug":["extensions","aria","xml_instrument_bank"],"title":"XML instrument bank","content":"An ARIA-specific element, an XML bank is a collection of several SFZ instruments\nin one instrument bank.

This is because once a note is played, its MIDI note number and\nnote on velocity remain the same for that note. MIDI CC, however, is shared\nacross the entire instrument, and this means another note on or note off event\nwill change CC 131, 132 and 133. This can give unexpected results when using\nthese CCs to adjust keytracking or velocity tracking of various parameters,\nespecially in polyphonic instruments with long-sustaining sounds.\n\nNote gate is an on/off - it's 0 when no MIDI notes are pressed, and 1 when\nat least one note is currently pressed. Unipolar random is from 0 to 1.\nBipolar random is from -1 to 1. Alternate changes between 0 and 1 every time\na note on message is received.\n\nSome of the parameters, such as aftertouch and note off velocity, are rarely\nsupported by modern MIDI hardware controllers, though they are part of the MIDI\nspecification and can be edited in DAWs. Many MIDI keyboards will send a\ndefault note off velocity, such as 64, with every note off event regardless of\nhow fast the key was actually moving at the time.\n\nAnything above 137 is not specified in the SFZ 2 standard and strictly\nengine-dependent. ARIA adds more. Some of these might not work properly in\nall DAWs.\n\n- keydelta: 140\n- keydelta absolute: 141\n- host tempo (bpm): 142\n- host transport status (0 is off, 1 on in non-loop mode, 2 is playing in loop mode): 143\n- host sample rate: 144\n- time since the engine has been up: 145\n- current time signature numerator: 146\n- current time signature denominator: 147\n- position since song start in PPQ (pulses per quarter note): 148\n- position since bar start in PPQ: 149\n- time since the instrument has been up: 150\n- time since last key on (in seconds): 151\n- time since last key off (in seconds): 152\n- number of keys currently down: 153\n- number of currently active voices: 154\n- last playahead (offset) of any sample in the instrument: 155\n\n## Practical Considerations\n\nWhile all the \"regular\" CCs have the same range of 0 to 127, and some of these extended CCs\nbehave the same way (for example CC 131 or note on velocity), others do not. CC136 or bipolar\nrandom can have a negative value, for example. Many will often have non-integer values. These \nCCs will not always behave the same as others and have not been thoroughly documented.\n\nSome of the additional CCs are shared across all instances of the ARIA engine currently running,\nfor example the host tempo. Others can have concurrently have a different value for different\ninstances or different instruments concurrently, for example keydelta.\n\nCC 140 and 141 are measured in half-steps. So, the below will result in an envelope with a depth\nof 100 cents per half-step. This is typically what would be used for portamento glides.\n\n```\neg07_pitch_oncc140=100\n```\n\nUsing locc and hicc with CC 140 and 141 does not work the same as for other CCs. However, they\ncan be used with lohdcc and hihdcc. For example, the below will restrict a region to play only\nwhen the interval between the current note and the previous one is an octave, ascending. Whether\nthe decimal is necessary needs to be tested, but the below is confirmed to work.\n\n```\nlohdc140=12\nhihdcc140=12.1\n```\n\nUsing lohdcc alone does not work and will result in the region not triggering, but adding hihdcc\nwith a high value will. The below example was tested in an instrument with a range of less than\ntwo octaves, and there works as a way to trigger some regions only when the interval is more than\none octave in either direction.\n\n```\nlohdcc141=12.1\nhihdcc141=24\n```\n\nCC 151 is reset as soon as a new note is hit, so it cannot be used to measure\nthe time between the previous note and the current one, for adaptive legato\nspeed purposes. It can, however, be used to control the triggering of release samples. Like\nCC140 and CC141, it also requires using hdcc to function properly - which makes sense, as\ntime since note-on as measured in seconds usually involves fractions of a second in real\nscenarios.\n\nIn Cakewalk Dimension Pro, 140 is bitred and 141 is decim.\n\n[ARIA]:  /opcodes/?v=aria\n[SFZ 2]: /opcodes/?v=2\n[MIDI Control Change Messages]: https://www.midi.org/specifications-old/item/table-3-control-change-messages-data-bytes-2\n"},{"slug":["headers","control"],"title":"‹control›","content":"SFZ 2 header which should come before ‹[global](global)› in the file,\nand can contain the following special directives,\nwhich should not be used under other headers:\n\n- [#define](/opcodes/define)\n- [default_path](/opcodes/default_path)\n- [note_offset](/opcodes/note_offset)\n- [octave_offset](/opcodes/octave_offset)\n- [label_ccN](/opcodes/label_ccN)\n- [set_ccN](/opcodes/set_ccN)\n\nMultiple \u003ccontrol\u003e headers can be used in one file, and this can be very\nuseful when specifying default_path.

Mathematically, this\ncan cause very chaotic results. However, in the Cakewalk products (and possibly\nalso in ARIA, though this is not checked) this is simplified. If the number of the\nmodulating LFO is lower than the LFO being modulated (for example, LFO1 modulates\nLFO2), the modulation is applied when it is calculated. However, if the number\nof the modulating LFO is higher than the LFO being modulated (for example, LFO4\nmodulating LFO2), the modulation is not applied until the next LFO frequency\nupdate cycle.\n\nThis both keeps LFO feedback controlled, and reduces the CPU needed to calculate\nLFO modulations.\n"},{"slug":["modulations","moved","ampeg_vel2attack"],"title":"modulations/moved/ampeg_vel2attack","content":"## Examples\n\n```\npitcheg_vel2delay=-1.2\nampeg_vel2delay=0.1\n```\n\nAttack time will be calculated as\n\n***attack time = (eg type)_delay + (eg type)_vel2delay * velocity / 127***\n\nRange is -100 seconds to 100 seconds, but in most typical cases, the effect of\nvelocity on envelope delay and attack times will be negative, and the effect\nof velocity on other envelope parameters positive.

Note that there's no reason to set amp_velcurve_N values for N\nbelow the lovel or above the hivel for a particular region.

Note that\n`hirand` for a region should equal `lorand` for the next region - if we had, for\nexample, `hirand`=0.249 for the first region and `lorand`=0.25 for the next,\nthat would result in no sound playing if the random number generated was, for\nexample, 0.2496343491.

This can be good when there are\na lot (6 or more) round robin samples available.

Using it can result in triggering spot, overhead and room\nmics which do not match, and that can result in phasing issues etc.\n\nThere are other potential uses which have nothing to do with round robins, for\nexample having key fingering noises on a clarinet trigger sometimes\n(but not always) when a note is played.\n"},{"slug":["opcodes","hitimer"],"title":"lotimer / hitimer","content":"## Practical Considerations\n\nNot implemented in ARIA, may have been implemented in some Cakewalk products.\nIf implemented, the unit would be seconds, but it is not clear what the timer\nis or how it's intended to be used.\n"},{"slug":["opcodes","hivel"],"title":"lovel / hivel","content":"This is obviously useful for instruments with dynamic layers controlled by velocity.\nThough dynamic layers can also be controlled by CC, especially for sustained\ninstruments, `lovel` and `hivel` are the standard way of controlling dynamics for\ninstruments such as drums and pianos. It is also possible to use `lovel` / `hivel`\nto control other things instead, such as articulations - for example, a guitar\ncould have palm-muted samples on low velocities, and pinch harmonics on velocity 127.\n\nThese opcodes will often need to be used with [amp_velcurve_N](/opcodes/amp_velcurve_N),\nunless [amp_veltrack](/opcodes/amp_veltrack) is set to 0. The reason for this is\nthat with default velocity tracking behavior and non-normalized samples (and\nthere are many reasons why normalizing samples should be avoided), the quiet\nvelocity layers will be too quiet.\n\nVelocity 0 is a note-off message, so 1 is the lowest usable value with hivel/lovel.\n\n## Example\n\n```\nlovel=64 hivel=95\n```\n\nAn instrument with four velocity-controlled dynamic layers might use `lovel` and\n`hivel` like this:\n\n```\n\u003cregion\u003ehivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 sample=kick_vl1.wav\n\u003cregion\u003elovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 sample=kick_vl2.wav\n\u003cregion\u003elovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 sample=kick_vl3.wav\n\u003cregion\u003elovel=96 sample=kick_vl4.wav\n```\n\nThe way this would work is the kick_vl1.wav region will play at velocities up\nto 31, with volume going gradually from 0 at velocity 0 (so, no sound) to full\nvolume at velocity 31. The kick_vl2.wav region will play at velocties 32 to 63,\nwith volume being full at velocity 63 and lower volume (but not zero) at 32.\nThe kick_vl3 wav region will play at velocites 64 to 95, with full volume at\nvelocity 95.

A guitar is polyphonic, but each string\nis monophonic, so a six-string guitar would naturally be split into six groups -\none per string. In these cases, the `group` number will be equal to the [off_by]\nnumber.\n\nThis is also commonly used with hi-hats - this is an example of where things can\nget more sophisticated with a large number of groups involved, as it's possible\nto set more closed hi-hat sounds mute more open ones, but not vice-versa, and it's\nalso quite possible that there are separate close mic, overhead and room samples.\n\n`group` and [off_by] can also be used in other contexts where one sound\nshould cause another to stop but enforcing monophony is not the goal - for example,\na crash cymbal doesn't need to be monophonic, as allowing the sound to build up\nis reasonably natural, but if we wanted to implement a cymbal choke, then the\ncrash sounds would be in one group, the choke samples in another.\n\n## Practical Considerations\n\nThe actual minimum and maximum values are not currently known. Some players\nwill treat numbers outside a certain range as equivalent to group=0, and\nARIA/Sforzando will also do this with text strings. The behavior of\nnon-integer numbers is also currently unknown.

An alternative for controlling sound buildup is using\n[ampeg_release](ampeg_release) with [off_mode](off_mode) set to normal.\n\nIt's also possible to have a group with limited polyphony which can be muted by\nanother group, such as a cymbal with edge chokes.\n\n```\n\u003cgroup\u003e\ngroup=2\noff_by=3\npolyphony=7\n\u003cregion\u003e key=51 sample=ride_bow.wav\n\u003cregion\u003e key=53 sample=ride_bell.wav\n\n\u003cgroup\u003e\ngroup=3\n\u003cregion\u003e key=54 sample=ride.choke.wav\n```\nAn alternative is [note_polyphony](/opcodes/note_polyphony). The difference between\napplying polyphony across one note and using note_polyphony is that note_polyphony also uses\n[note_selfmask](/opcodes/note_selfmask) which opens up some additional\noptions. With the default setting, lower-velocity notes do not mute higher-velocity\nones. This is useful for long-ringing instruments such as piano with the sustain pedal\npressed down or hammered dulcimer. It can also be useful for cymbals, although\nespecially with hi-hats, those will often use different notes for different\narticulations, and note_polyphony would be limited to working within an\narticulation.\n"},{"slug":["opcodes","position_curveccN"],"title":"opcodes/position_curveccN","content":"A value of zero means centered, negative values move the panoramic to the left,\npositive to the right.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n// mix both channels and play the result at left\nwidth=0 position=-100\n\n// make the stereo image narrower and play it\n// slightly right\nwidth=50 position=30\n\n// position modulated by MIDI CC 40 width=50 position_oncc40=-50\n```\n"},{"slug":["opcodes","position_keycenter"],"title":"opcodes/position_keycenter","content":""},{"slug":["opcodes","position_keytrack"],"title":"opcodes/position_keytrack","content":""},{"slug":["opcodes","position_onccN"],"title":"opcodes/position_onccN","content":"A value of zero means centered, negative values move the panoramic to the left,\npositive to the right.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n// mix both channels and play the result at left\nwidth=0 position=-100\n\n// make the stereo image narrower and play it\n// slightly right\nwidth=50 position=30\n\n// position modulated by MIDI CC 40 width=50 position_oncc40=-50\n```\n"},{"slug":["opcodes","position_random"],"title":"opcodes/position_random","content":""},{"slug":["opcodes","position_smoothccN"],"title":"opcodes/position_smoothccN","content":"A value of zero means centered, negative values move the panoramic to the left,\npositive to the right.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n// mix both channels and play the result at left\nwidth=0 position=-100\n\n// make the stereo image narrower and play it\n// slightly right\nwidth=50 position=30\n\n// position modulated by MIDI CC 40 width=50 position_oncc40=-50\n```\n"},{"slug":["opcodes","position_stepccN"],"title":"opcodes/position_stepccN","content":"A value of zero means centered, negative values move the panoramic to the left,\npositive to the right.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n// mix both channels and play the result at left\nwidth=0 position=-100\n\n// make the stereo image narrower and play it\n// slightly right\nwidth=50 position=30\n\n// position modulated by MIDI CC 40 width=50 position_oncc40=-50\n```\n"},{"slug":["opcodes","position_veltrack"],"title":"opcodes/position_veltrack","content":""},{"slug":["opcodes","position"],"title":"opcodes/position","content":"A value of zero means centered, negative values move the panoramic to the left,\npositive to the right.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n// mix both channels and play the result at left\nwidth=0 position=-100\n\n// make the stereo image narrower and play it\n// slightly right\nwidth=50 position=30\n\n// position modulated by MIDI CC 40 width=50 position_oncc40=-50\n```\n"},{"slug":["opcodes","region_label"],"title":"opcodes/region_label","content":"Useful for debugging.

Assuming that the tune or transpose opcodes are not\nused to change the pitch, the sample will play unchanged in pitch when a note\nequal to the [pitch_keycenter](pitch_keycenter) opcode value is played.\nIf [pitch_keycenter](pitch_keycenter) is not defined for the region, sample will\nplay unchanged on note 60 (middle C).

Setting it to 64 is preferred by some users who want to use the\nsustain pedal as an on/off sustain switch for instruments with no half-pedaling.\n\nPlease note that the direction of the MIDI CC values is normally from 0 at the\ntop of the pedal to 127 when it is at the bottom, meaning that physically \"down\"\non the pedal is up in terms of MIDI CC value.\n\nIt is possible to set this to different values for different regions, so that\nfor example mechanical noises and notes will not be affected by the sustain pedal\nin the same way.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nsustain_lo=64\nsustain_lo=20\n```\n"},{"slug":["opcodes","sustain_sw"],"title":"opcodes/sustain_sw","content":"## Example\n\n```\nsustain_sw=off\n```\n"},{"slug":["opcodes","sw_default"],"title":"sw_default / sw_label","content":"`sw_default` sets a default value for [sw_last].

The velocity which matters here is\nthe note-on velocity of the initial region - not the velocity of the note-off message\nwhich triggers the release region. Round robins do not need to match, so it is possible\nto for example have five round robins for releases and only four round robins for\nattacks.\n\nThis corresponding attack region is then used to calculate the volume of the release\nregion based on the attack region's velocity and [rt_decay](/opcodes/rt_decay). If there is\nno corresponding attack region, or the corresponding attack region has finished playing due\nto reaching sample end etc, then the release region will not play. This is designed primarily\ndesigned for piano release samples.\n\nTriggering a release sample without a corresponding attack region is is useful for release\nsamples which are noises not dependent on the volume of any corresponding note, such\nas hurdy-gurdy key returns, which will sound the same whether the wheel is turning\nor not.\n\nMore detail about release sample behavior in different SFZ players can be found at\nhttps://github.com/kinwie/sfztest/wiki/How-Release-Trigger-Works-in-SFZ\n\n[on_locc/on_hicc](/opcodes/on_loccN) effectively replaces the default trigger=attack,\nas it is used for regions which are to be triggered by MIDI CC messages and not MIDI\nnote messages.
